<p>The island Britain is 800 miles long, and 200
broad, and there are in this island five nations,
English, Britons or Welch, Scots, Picts, and
Romans. The Britons were the first inhabitants
of the land; they came from Armenia, and first
settled in the south of Britain; afterwards it fell
out that the Picts came from the south of Scythia,
with long ships, but not many, and they first
landed in the north of Ireland, and they entreated
the Scots that they might abide there, and they
would not permit them; but the Scots said to
them, We may nevertheless give you counsel;
we know another island eastward of this, there
you may live if you will, and if any withstand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>you, we will aid you that you may conquer it.
Then the Picts departed, and came to the northern
part of this land, for southward the Britons possessed
it, as we said before. And the Picts took
wives of the Scots, on condition that they should
always choose their Royal lineage on the woman’s
side, and they observed this custom long after.
And it happened, in the course of years, that a
division of the Scots passed from Ireland into
Britain, and conquered some part of this land,
and their leader was called Reoda; from him
they are named the Dælreodi. Sixty years before
Christ was born, Caius Julius, the Roman
Emperor, came to Britain with 80 ships. He
was at first overcome in a terrible battle, and lost
great part of his army, and he left the remainder
of his forces to abide with the Scots, and went
into Gaul, and there he collected 600 ships, with
which he returned to Britain, and at the first onset
Cæsar’s lieutenant, named Labienus, was
slain. Then the Britons took large and sharp
stakes, and drove them into the fording place of
a certain river, under the water; this river was
called the Thames. When the Romans discovered
this, they would not go over the ford: then
the Britons fled to the wood fastnesses, and the
Emperor conquered very many of their chief
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>towns by great battles, and he passed again into
Gaul.</p>


<p class="center">1.</p>

<p>Octavianus reigned 56 years, and in the 42d
year of his reign Christ was born: then astrologers

were slain in Herod’s search after him.</p>


<p class="center">3.</p>

<p>This year Herod died, having stabbed himself,
and his son Archelaus succeeded to the
kingdom. And the child Christ was brought

<p>This year Claudius, second of the Roman
Emperors, came to the land of Britain, and
brought under his power the greater part of this
island, he also subjected the Orkney islands to

of his reign, and the same year was the great
famine in Syria, which is spoken of by Luke,

<p>This year Marcus Antoninus, and Aurelius his
brother, took to themselves the Empire.</p>


<p class="center">189.</p>

<p>This year Severus possessed himself of the
Empire, and came into Britain with an army,
and conquered great part of the island by battle;
and then he built a rampart of turf, and a
thick wall thereon, from sea to sea, for a defence
to the Britons. He reigned 17 years, and then
finished his days at York, and Bassianus<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> his son
succeeded to the Empire. His other son died.
He was called Geza. This year Eleutherus received
the bishoprick of Rome, and held it with
glory 15 years: to him Lucius, King of the Britons,
sent letters, and entreated that he might be

<p>This year the Emperor Maximus assumed the
government: he was born in Britain, and thence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>he went into Gaul, and there he slew the Emperor
Gratian, and he drove his brother named
Valentinian out of the country, and this Valentinian

<p class="center">403.</p>

<p>“This year Pope Innocent sent an epistle to

<p class="center">418.</p>

<p>This year the Romans collected all the gold

<p class="center">423.</p>

<p>This year Theodosius the younger succeeded
to the Empire.</p>


<p class="center">425.</p>

<p>“At this time the series of French Kings began
to reign: Pharamond was the first.”</p>


<p class="center">429.</p>

<p>This year the Bishop Palladius was sent by
Pope Celestine to the Scotch, that he might confirm
their faith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p class="center">430.</p>

Bishop of Constantinople, at which Synod
Cyril Bishop of Alexandria, presided.”</p>


<p class="center">435.</p>

<p>This year the Goths took Rome, and never
after did the Romans reign in Britain. This

synod of Calchedon.”</p>


<p class="center">443.</p>

<p>This year the Britons sent over sea to Rome,
and begged for aid against the Picts, but they
obtained none, because the Romans were going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>against Ætla, King of the Huns; and then they
sent to the Angles, and asked the same of the
Princes of the Angle race.</p>


<p class="center">444.</p>

<p>This year St. Martin died.</p>


<p class="center">448.</p>

<p>This year, at the place where Herod formerly
resided, John the Baptist discovered his head to
two monks, who came from the east to pray at
Jerusalem.</p>


<p class="center">449.</p>

<p>This year Martian and Valentinian<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> succeeded
to the Empire, and reigned seven years. In
their days Hengest and Horsa, called by Vortigern
King of the Britons to his aid, landed in
Britain at the place which is called Ypwinesfleot
(Ebsfleet): they at first assisted, but afterwards
made war upon the Britons. The King
commanded them to fight against the Picts, and
they did so, and gained the victory wherever
they came; then they sent to the Angles, and desired
them to send more aid, and told them of the
imbecility of the inhabitants, and of the excellence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>of this land. Thereupon they sent more forces;
these came from three tribes in Germany; from
the Old Saxons, from the Angles, and from the
Jutes. From the Jutes came the men of Kent and
of Wight; this is the people that now dwelleth
in Wight, and the tribe among the West Saxons
which is yet called the race of Jutes. From the
Old Saxons came the East, the South, and the
West Saxons. From the Angles (whose country
lying between the Jutes and the Saxons, remained
deserted from that time) came the East Angles,
the Mid Angles, the Mercians, and all the Northumbrians:
their leaders were the two brothers
Hengest and Horsa, and they were the sons of
Wihtgils; Wihtgils was the son of Witta, Witta
of Wecta, Wecta of Woden: from this Woden
the line of our Kings is descended, and that of
the Southumbrian Kings also.</p>

<p>“At this time a synod of 630 Bishops was
held at Calchedon against the Abbot Eutyches
and Dioscorus.”</p>


<p class="center">455.</p>

<p>This year Hengest and Horsa fought with
King Vortigern, at the place which is called
Ægeles-ford (Aylesford) and Horsa, the brother
of Hengest was slain, and, after this, Hengest and
his son Æsc assumed the government.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p class="center">457.</p>

<p>This year Hengest and Æsc fought with the
Britons at the place called Creccanford (Crayford)
and there they slew four chieftains, and then
the Britons forsook Kent, and fled in great fear
to London.</p>


<p class="center">465.</p>

<p>This year Hengest and Æsc fought with the
Welsh near Wyppedes-fleote (Wippedfleet) and
they slew twelve Aldermen, all Welsh; and one
of their own Thanes, whose name was Wipped,
was killed there.</p>


<p class="center">473.</p>

<p>This year Hengest &amp; Æsc fought with the Welsh,
and gained spoils innumerable, and then the Welsh
fled from the English, as they would from fire.</p>


<p class="center">477.</p>

<p>This year Ælla, with his three sons, Cymen,
and Wlencing, and Cissa, arrived in Britain with
three ships, at the place which is called Cymenesora
(Cimen Shore, Sussex) and there they slew
many of the Welsh, and chased some into the
wood which is named Andredes-leage.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>


<p class="center">482.</p>

<p>This year the blessed Abbot Benedict shone in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>this world through the glory of his miracles,
even as the blessed Gregory relateth in the book
of dialogues.</p>


<p class="center">485.</p>

<p>This year Ælla fought with the Welch near
Mearcredes-burnan-stede.</p>


<p class="center">488.</p>

<p>This year Æsc succeeded to the kingdom, and
reigned over the Kentish men 24 years.</p>


<p class="center">490.</p>

<p>This year Ælla and Cissa besieged Andredes-cester,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
and they slew all the inhabitants, so
that not one Briton was left there.</p>

<p>“At this time the blessed Mamercus, Bishop
of Vienne, appointed the solemn Rogation
Litany.”</p>


<p class="center">495.</p>

<p>This year two Aldermen, Cerdic and his son
Cynric, arrived in Britain with five ships at the
place which is called Cerdices-ora (near Yarmouth),
and the same day they fought with the
Welch. And Cerdic was the son of Elesa, Elesa of
Esla, Esla of Giwis, Giwis of Wig, Wig of Freawine,
Freawine of Freothogar, Freothogar of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>Brand, Brand of Baldæg, Baldæg of Woden;
and in about six years from the time Cerdic and
Cynric landed, they conquered the country of the
West Saxons, and they were the first Kings who
took the West Saxon land from the Welsh. And
Cerdic possessed that kingdom 16 years, then he
died and his son Cynric succeeded him, and held
it 26 years. When he died his son Ceawlin succeeded
to the kingdom, and reigned 17 years;
when he died Ceol succeeded and reigned five
years; when he died his brother Ceolwulf succeeded
and reigned 17 years, and their line
goeth back to Cerdic; then Cynegils, the brother’s
son of Ceolwulf, succeeded and reigned 20 years,
and he was the first of the West Saxon Kings
who received baptism; and then Cenwalh succeeded
to the kingdom, and held it 31 years; this
Cenwalh was the son of Cynegils; and then his
Queen Sexburh reigned one year after him; then
Æscwine, whose genealogy goeth back to Cerdic,
reigned two years; then Centwine, the son of
Cynegils, succeeded to the kingdom of Wessex,
and reigned nine years; then Ceadwalla, whose
genealogy goeth back to Cerdic, succeeded to the
kingdom, and reigned three years; then Ina,
whose line goeth back to Cerdic, succeeded to
the kingdom of Wessex, and reigned 37 years;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>then Æthelheard, whose genealogy goeth back
to Cerdic, succeeded and reigned 16 years; then
Cuthred, whose genealogy goeth back to Cerdic,
succeeded and reigned 17 years; then Sigebright,
whose line goeth back to Cerdic, succeeded and
reigned one year; then Cynewulf, whose line
goeth back to Cerdic, succeeded and reigned 31
years; then Brihtric, whose line goeth back to
Cerdic, succeeded to the kingdom, and reigned
16 years; then Ecgbriht succeeded and reigned
37 years and 7 months; then his son Athelwulf
succeeded and reigned 18 years and a half. Athelwulf
was the son of Ecgbriht, Ecgbriht of Ealhmund,
Ealhmund of Eafa, Eafa of Eoppa, Eoppa
of Ingild, Ingild of Cenred; Ina and Cuthburh
and Cwenburh were also the children of Cenred;
and Cenred was the son of Ceolwald, Ceolwald
of Cuthwulf, Cuthwulf of Cuthwine, Cuthwine
of Celm, Celm of Cynric, Cynric of Creoda,
Creoda of Cerdic. Then Æthelbald, the son of
Athelwulf succeeded to the kingdom, and held it

<p class="center">538.</p>

<p>This year, 14 days before the March calends,
the sun was eclipsed from early in the morning
till nine in the forenoon.</p>


<p class="center">540.</p>

<p>This year the sun was eclipsed on the 12th of
the calends of July, and the stars were seen at
nearly half-past nine in the forenoon.</p>


<p class="center">544.</p>

<p>This year Wihtgar died, and was buried at
Wihtgarabyrig (Carisbrook).</p>


<p class="center">547.</p>

<p>This year Ida assumed the government; from
him descended the Northumbrian royal line.—Ida
was the son of Eoppa, Eoppa of Esa, Esa
of Ingin, Ingin of Angenwit, Angenwit of Aloc,
Aloe of Beonoc, Beonoc of Brand, Brand of
Bældæg, Bældæg of Woden, Woden of Freotholaf,
Freotholaf of Frithowulf, Frithowulf of
Finn, Finn of Godwulf, Godwulf of Geat: and
Ida reigned 12 years, and built Bebbanburh

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="center">552.</p>

Gewis, Gewis of Wig, Wig of Freawine, Freawine
of Frithogar, Frithogar of Brand, Brand
of Bældæg, Bældæg of Woden. Egelberht
(Ethelberht), the son of Eormenric was born,

(Saxon) Kings of Britain, received baptism.</p>


<p class="center">556.</p>

<p>This year Cynric and Ceawlin fought with the
Britons at Beranbyrig (Banbury).</p>


<p class="center">560.</p>

<p>This year Ceawlin succeeded to the kingdom
of Wessex; and (Ida being dead), Ælla to that
of Northumberland,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> and he held it 30 years.
Ælla was the son of Yffe, Yffe of Uscfrea, Uscfrea

Woden, Woden of Frithowulf. This year
Æthelbriht succeeded to the kingdom of Kent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>and reigned 53 years. In his days the holy Pope
Gregory sent us baptism, this was in the 32d
year of his reign. And the Priest Columba
came to the Picts, and converted those who live
by the northern moors to the faith of Christ:
and their King gave him the island that is called
Ii (Iona); it contains five hides of land, and
there, as men say, Columba built a monastery,
and he lived there as Abbot 32 years, and he
died there when he was 77 years old. The place
is still in the possession of his heirs. The
southern Picts were baptized long before by
Bishop Ninna, who was educated at Rome.—His
church and monastery consecrated in the
name of St. Martin, are at Hwiterne (Whitehorn),
and there he resteth with many holy men.
Now there shall ever be an Abbot and not a
Bishop in Iona, and all the Scotch Bishops shall
be subject to him, because Columba was an
Abbot and no Bishop.</p>


<p class="center">568.</p>

<p>This year Ceawlin and his brother Cutha
fought with Æthelbyrht and drove him into

reigned after him five years.</p>


<p class="center">591.</p>

<p>This year there was a great slaughter in Britain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>at Wodnes-beorg (in Wiltshire?) and Ceawlin
was driven out, and Ceolric reigned six years.</p>


<p class="center">592.</p>

<p>This year Gregory succeeded to the Popedom
of Rome.</p>

<p>“This Pope Gregory added to the mass service
the words, <i>Diesque nostros in tuâ pace disponas,
&amp;c.</i>”</p>


<p class="center">593.</p>

<p>This year Ceawlin and Cwichelm and Cryda,
(King of Mercia) died, and Æthelfrith succeeded
to the kingdom of Northumberland; he was the
son of Æthelric, and Æthelric of Ida.</p>


<p class="center">596.</p>

<p>This year Pope Gregory sent Augustine, with
many monks, into Britain, to preach the word of
God to the English people.</p>

<p>“At this time St. Benedict’s Monastery was
destroyed by the Lombards.”</p>


<p class="center">597.</p>

<p>This year Ceolwulf began to reign over the
West Saxons, and he was always at war, and

of Woden. This year Augustine and his companions
came to England.</p>


<p class="center">601.</p>

<p>This year Pope Gregory sent a pall into Britain
for Archbishop Augustine; he also sent many divines
to his assistance, and the Bishop Paulinus
brought Edwin King of Northumberland to be
baptized.</p>


<p class="center">603.</p>

<p>This year Ægthan, King of the Scots, fought
with the Dælreodi, and with Æthelferth, King
of Northumberland, at Dægstane,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> and almost
the whole of his army was destroyed. Theodbald,
the brother of Æthelferth, was slain there
with all his troop. Never after durst any Scotch
King lead an army against this people.</p>


<p class="center">604.</p>

<p>This year Augustin consecrated two bishops,
Mellitus and Justus: he sent Mellitus to preach
baptism to the East Saxons, where there was a
King named Sæbyrht, the son of Ricola the sister
of Æthelbyrht, whom Æthelbyrht had established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>there as King; and Æthelbyrht gave Mellitus
a Bishop’s see at London, and to Justus he gave
one at Rochester which is 24 miles from Dorwitceaster
(Canterbury).</p>


<p class="center">606.</p>

<p>This year Gregory died, about ten years from
the time that he sent us baptism; his father was
named Gordian, and his mother Silvia.</p>


<p class="center">607.</p>

<p>This year Ceolwulf fought with the South
Saxons. And this year Æthelfrith led his army
to Leger-ciestre (Leicester) and there he slew
Welshmen without number, and thus was fulfilled
the prophecy of Augustin which he spoke, saying,
If the Welsh will not be at peace with us,
they shall perish at the hands of the Saxons. Two
hundred priests were slain, who came thither that
they might pray for the Welch army; their Alderman
was named Brocmail, and he escaped thence
with some fifty men.</p>


<p class="center">611.</p>

<p>This year Cynegils succeeded to the kingdom
of Wessex, and held it 31 years. Cynegils was
the son of Ceol, Ceol of Cutha, Cutha of
Cynric.</p>


<p class="center">614.</p>

<p>This year Cynegils and Cwichelm fought at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>Beamdune (Bampton, Devon?) and slew two
thousand and forty-six Welshmen.</p>


<p class="center">616.</p>

<p>This year died Æthelbyrht, King of Kent, the
first English King who received baptism, and he
was the son of Eormenric; he had reigned 56
years, and his son Eadbald succeeded him. And
the same year 5,818 winters had passed away
since the beginning of this world. Eadbald renounced
his faith, and lived after the heathen
manner, insomuch that he had to wife his father’s
widow. Whereupon Laurentius, who was then
Archbishop of Kent, resolved to go southward
over sea, and to abandon all here. And the
Apostle Peter came to him by night, and beat
him sorely, because he would thus have forsaken
the flock of God; and he commanded him to go
to the King, and to preach the true faith to him;
and he did so, and the King was converted unto
the true faith again. In this King’s days the
same Laurentius, who was Archbishop of Kent
after Augustin, died on the 4th of the Nones of
February, and he was buried near Augustin. The
holy Augustin, when in perfect health, consecrated
him Bishop, to the end that the Church
of Christ, which was yet new in England, might
have no interval without an Archbishop after his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>death. After Laurentius, Mellitus, who was
before Bishop of London, succeeded to the Archbishoprick;
then the inhabitants of London, where
Mellitus had been, became heathens, and within
five years, Eadbald still reigning, Mellitus died.
Justus succeeded to the Archbishoprick; he had
been Bishop of Rochester, and he consecrated
Romanus to that bishoprick.</p>


<p class="center">617.</p>

<p>This year Æthelfrith King of the Northumbrians,
was slain by Redwald King of the East
Angles, and Edwin the son of Ælla obtained possession
of the kingdom, and conquered all Britain,
excepting Kent alone, and he drove out the
Princes the sons of Æthelfrith; these were, first
Eanfrid, then Oswald and Oswin, Oslac, Oswudu,
Oslaf and Offa.</p>


<p class="center">624.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Mellitus died.</p>


<p class="center">625.</p>

<p>This year Paulinus was consecrated Bishop of
Northumberland by Archbishop Justus, on the
12th of the calends of August.</p>

<p>“This is the Cycle of Dionysius. It consists
of five series of nineteen years, that is of 95 years,
and it takes its beginning from the 30th year of
our Lord’s incarnation, and finishes in the 626th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>year. This series of nineteen years, which the
Greeks call Enneakaidekaeteris, and Pope John
calls Kaideris, was established by the holy
Fathers in the Council of Nice, and agreeably to
such mode of calculating the 14th day of the
(March) moon marked Easter every year without
any uncertainty.”</p>


<p class="center">626.</p>

<p>This year came Eomer from Cwichelm, King
of Wessex, and thought to murder King Edwin,
but he stabbed his thane Lilla, and Forthher,
and wounded the King. And the same night a
daughter was born to Edwin; she was named
Eanfled: then the King promised Paulinus that
he would dedicate his daughter to God, if he
would obtain of God that he might destroy his
enemy who had sent the assassin. And he then
marched with an army against the West Saxons,
and there he overcame five Kings and slew
much people. This year Eanfled, King Edwin’s
daughter, was baptized on the holy eve of Pentecost,
and within twelve months the King was
baptized at Easter with all his nobility. Easter
then fell on the 2d of the Ides of April. This
took place at York, where he had before ordered
a church of wood to be built, which was consecrated
in the name of St. Peter. There the King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>gave Paulinus a Bishop’s See, and there he afterwards
ordered a larger church to be built of
stone. This year Penda succeeded to the kingdom
(of Mercia) and reigned 30 years, and he
was 50 years old when he began to reign. Penda
was the son of Wybba, Wybba of Cryda, Cryda
of Cynewold, Cynewold of Cnebba, Cnebba of
Icel, Icel of Eomær, Eomær of Angeltheow, Angeltheow
of Offa, Offa of Wærmund, Wærmund
of Wihtlæg, Wihtlæg of Woden.</p>


<p class="center">627.</p>

<p>This year King Edwin was baptized with his
people by Paulinus, at Easter. This Paulinus
also preached Christianity in Lindisse (Lindsey),
where a certain rich man named Blecca believed
first, with all his adherents. And at this time
Honorius succeeded to the Popedom after Boniface;
he sent a pall hither to Paulinus. And
Archbishop Justus died, and Honorius was consecrated
Archbishop of Canterbury by Paulinus
at Lincoln, and the Pope also sent a pall to him,
and he sent letters to the Scotch that they should
turn to the observance of the true Easter.</p>


<p class="center">628.</p>

<p>This year Cynegils and Cwichelm fought with
Penda at Cirencester, and they made a treaty
there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p class="center">632.</p>

<p>This year Eorpwald was baptized.</p>


<p class="center">633.</p>

<p>This year King Edwin was slain by Cadwalla
and Penda at Heth-felda (Hatfield, near Doncaster?)
on the 2d of the Ides of October, and he
had reigned 17 years, and his son Osfrith also
was slain with him. And after this Ceadwalla
and Penda went and laid waste all Northumberland.
When Paulinus saw this, he took Æthelburga,
the widow of Edwin, and went in a ship
to Kent, and Eadbald and Honorius received him
very honorably, and gave him the Bishoprick of
Rochester, and he abode there till his death.</p>


<p class="center">634.</p>

<p>This year Osric, whom Paulinus had baptized,
succeeded to the kingdom of Deira; he was the
son of Ælfric, the uncle of Edwin; and Eanfrith,
the son of Æthelfrith, succeeded to the kingdom
of Bernicia. And this year Bishop Byrinus first
preached baptism to the West Saxons under King
Cynegils: this Byrinus came thither by the command
of Pope Honorius, and was Bishop there
till the end of his life. And this year also Oswald
succeeded to the kingdom of Northumberland,
and he reigned nine years, the ninth year being
numbered to him because of the heathenism of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>those who reigned the one year between him and
Edwin.</p>


<p class="center">635.</p>

<p>This year King Cynegils was baptized by
Bishop Byrinus at Dorchester (Oxfordshire) and
Oswald, King of Northumberland, was his godfather.</p>


<p class="center">636.</p>

<p>This year King Cwichelm was baptized at
Dorchester (Oxfordshire), and he died the same
year; and Bishop Felix preached the Christian
faith to the East Angles.</p>


<p class="center">639.</p>

<p>This year Byrinus baptized King Cuthred at
Dorchester, and took him for his godson.</p>


<p class="center">640.</p>

<p>This year Eadbald, King of Kent, died; he
reigned 25 years. He had two sons, Ermenred
and Ercenberht, and Ercenberht reigned after his
father. He threw down all the idols in his kingdom,
and he was the first of English Kings who
appointed the fast before Easter. His daughter
was named Ercongota, an holy woman, as he was
a glorious man, and her mother was Sexburh, the
daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles:
and Ermenred had two sons, who were martyred
by Thunor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p class="center">642.</p>

<p>This year Oswald King of Northumberland
was slain by Penda the Southumbrian, at Maserfeld
(Oswestry) on the Nones of August, and his
body was buried at Bearthan-ege (Bardney, on
the Witham, Lincolnshire). His sanctity and
his miracles were afterwards greatly renowned
throughout the island, and his hands are preserved
incorrupted at Bamborough. And the same year
that Oswald was slain, his brother Oswiu succeeded
to the kingdom of Northumberland, and
reigned 28 years.</p>


<p class="center">643.</p>

<p>This year Cenwalh succeeded to the kingdom
of Wessex, and reigned 31 years. He caused
the old church of Winchester to be built, and
consecrated in the name of St. Peter. This Cenwalh
was the son of Cynegils.</p>


<p class="center">644.</p>

<p>This year Paulinus, who had been Archbishop
of York, (and afterwards Bishop of Rochester)
died at Rochester on the 6th of the ides of October;
he was a Bishop 19 years, two months,
and twenty-one days; and this year Oswin the
son of Osric, the cousin of Edwin, succeeded
to the kingdom of Deira, and reigned seven
years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p class="center">645.</p>

<p>This year King Cenwalh was driven from his
kingdom by King Penda.</p>


<p class="center">646.</p>

<p>This year King Cenwalh was baptized.</p>


<p class="center">648.</p>

<p>This year Cenwalh gave his kinsman Cuthred
3000 hides of land, near Æsces-dun (Aston,
Berkshire?). This Cuthred was the son of
Cwichelm, Cwichelm of Cynegils.</p>


<p class="center">650.</p>

<p>This year Ægelbyrht of Gaul received the
Bishoprick of Wessex, after the Roman Bishop
Byrinus.</p>


<p class="center">651.</p>

<p>This year King Oswin was slain on the 13th
of the calends of September; and about twelve
days afterwards Bishop Aidan died on the 2d of
the calends of September.</p>


<p class="center">652.</p>

<p>This year Cenwalh fought at Bradford on the
Avon.</p>


<p class="center">653.</p>

<p>This year the Mid Angles, under the Alderman
Peada, received the true faith.</p>


<p class="center">654.</p>

<p>This year King Anna was slain. And Botulf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>began to build the monastery at Icanhoe (Boston?)
And Archbishop Honorius died this year
on the 2d of the calends of October.</p>


<p class="center">655.</p>

<p>This year Penda was killed at Winwid-feld,
(on the river Winwed, now the Aire, near
Leeds) and with him 30 others of Royal lineage,
some of whom were Kings; amongst these was
Æthelhere, the brother of Anna King of the
East Angles: and the Mercians became Christians.
Then had 5,850 years passed away since the beginning
of the world. And Peada, the son of
Penda, succeeded to the kingdom of Mercia: he
and Oswin (Oswy?) the brother of King Oswald,
came together, and agreed that they would build
a monastery for the love of Christ, and to the
honour of St. Peter. And they did so, and they
gave it the name of Medeshamstede,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> because
there is at this place a whirlpool (in the river
Nen) called Medeswæl. And they began the
foundations, and wrought thereon, and they
committed the care of the work to a monk named
Saxulf; he was the friend of God, and all the
people loved him, and he was very nobly born
in the world, and rich, but he is now much richer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>with Christ. And king Peada reigned not long,
for he was betrayed by his own wife at Easter.
This year Ithamar Bishop of Rochester, consecrated
Deusdedit to the Archbishoprick of Canterbury,
on the 7th of the calends of April.</p>


<p class="center">656.</p>

<p>This year Peada was slain, and (after three
years) Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took possession
of the kingdom of Mercia. In his time
Medeshamstede, which his brother had founded,
became very rich: the King favoured it much
for love of his brother Peada, and for love of
Oswy his brother in baptism, and for love of the
Abbot Saxulf. Then he said he would make it
renowned and glorious, and this with the advice
of his brothers Æthelred and Merwala, of his
sisters Kyneburg and Kyneswith, with the advice
also of the Archbishop who was named Deusdedit,
and with that of all his wise men (gewitan)
both clergy and laity in the kingdom; and he
did so. Then the King sent to the Abbot that
he should come to him with all diligence, and he
came: then said the King to the Abbot, “I have
sent for thee, beloved Saxulf, for the good of
my soul, and I will clearly tell thee wherefore.
My brother Peada and my beloved friend Oswy
began a monastery for the love of Christ and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>St. Peter, and my brother is departed from this
life even as Christ willed, and I would pray thee,
O beloved friend, that they labour diligently at
this work, and I will find thee gold and silver
and land, and all and every thing that behooveth
thereto.” Then the Abbot went home and began
to work, and he sped as Christ enabled him, so
that in a few years the monastery was finished.
When the King heard that, he was very glad,
and he gave commandment to send throughout
the land to all his Thanes, to the Archbishops and
Bishops, and to his Earls, and to all who loved
God, that they should come to him, and he appointed
the day on which the monastery should
be consecrated. King Wulfere was present when
the monastery was consecrated, together with his
brother Æthelred and his sisters Kyneburg and
Kyneswith: and Deusdedit Archbishop of
Canterbury, and Ithamar Bishop of Rochester,
and the Bishop of London named Wina, and
Jeruman Bishop of Mercia, and Bishop Tuda
consecrated the monastery, and the priest Wilfred
who was afterwards a Bishop was there, and all
the Thanes who were in the kingdom. Then the
monastery was consecrated in the names of St.
Peter, St. Paul, and St. Andrew. Then the
King stood up before all his Thanes, and said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>with a loud voice, “Thanked be the high and
Almighty God, for the good deed that is here
done, and I will this day render honour to Christ,
and to St. Peter, and I will, that you all confirm
my words. I, Wulfere, do this day freely give
to St. Peter, and to the Abbot Saxulf, and to the
monks of this monastery, these lands and waters,
and meres, and fens, and wears, all that lie around
and are of my domain, so that none but the
abbot and the monks shall have any claim upon
them. This is the grant—from Medeshamstede
unto North-burh (Narborough) and thence to
the place which is called Folies, and all the fen
straight to Esendic,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> and from Esendic to the
place which is called Fethermuth, and thence 10
miles in a right line to Cuggedic, and so to Raggewilh,
from Raggewilh five miles to the river
which leadeth to Ælm (Elme) and Wisbeach,
and so about three miles to Throkonholt (Trokenhole),
and from Throkonholt direct through
all the fen which is 20 miles long to Derevord
(Denver?) and so to Grætecross, and from
Grætecross through the clear water called Bradan-æ,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>and thence six miles to Paccelade, and so
on through all the meres and fens that lie towards
the town of Huntingdon, and the meres
and the lakes Scælfremere and Witlesmere, and
all the others thereabout, with the lands and
houses that are on the eastern side of Scælfremere,
and all the fens thence to Medeshamstede and to
Welmes-ford (Welmsford) and from Welmes-ford
to Clive (Cliff) and thence to Æstun (Easton)
and from Æstun to Stan-ford (Stamford)
and from Stan-ford even as the water runneth to
the abovesaid North-burh (Narborough). These
are the lands and the fens which the King gave
to St. Peter’s monastery. Then said the King,
for this gift, it is little, but I will that they hold
it so royally and so freely, that neither tribute
nor tax be taken therefrom, excepting for the
monks only. Thus will I make this monastery
free, that it be subject to Rome alone: and I will
that all amongst us who may not be able to
journey to Rome should repair hither to St.
Peter.” Whilst he was thus speaking, the
Abbot entreated that he would grant that which
he should ask of him, and the King promised
that he would: “I have some monks here
who fear God, and would spend their lives
as Anchorites if they knew where; but there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>is an island here called Ancarig (Thorney),
and this would I ask, that we might there
build a monastery for the love of St. Mary,
and that those who would lead their lives in
peace and rest may dwell there.” Then the
King answered and spoke thus, “Not this only,
beloved Saxulf, but all things which I know that
thou desirest on our Lord’s behalf, even thus I
approve and grant. And I entreat thee, brother
Æthelred, and my sisters Cyneburh and Cyneswith,
for our soul’s redemption, that ye be witnesses,
and that ye write this with your fingers.
And I desire of all who succeed me, be they my
sons or my brethren, or whosoever shall reign
after me, that our gift may stand, even as they
would be partakers of eternal life, and as they
would escape everlasting torment. Whosoever
diminisheth our gift, or the gift of other good
men, let the heavenly porter diminish his part in
the kingdom of heaven, and whosoever increaseth
it, let the heavenly porter increase
his portion in the kingdom of heaven.” These
were the witnesses who were there, and who
subscribed with their fingers the cross of Christ,
and who confirmed the grant with their
tongues. King Wulfere was the first who confirmed
it by word, and afterwards subscribed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>to it with his fingers the cross of Christ, and
he spoke thus, “I King Wulfere having these
Kings, Earls, Generals, and Thanes as witnesses
of my gift, and before the Archbishop
Deusdedit, do confirm it with the cross of
Christ.” ♰ “And I Oswy King of Northumberland,
the friend of this monastery and of the
Abbot Saxulf, do sanction it with the cross of
Christ.” ♰ “And I King Sighere do confirm
the same with the cross of Christ.” ♰ “And I
King Sibbi do subscribe to it with the cross of
Christ.” ♰ “And I Æthelred the King’s brother
do confirm it with the cross of Christ.” ♰
“And we the King’s sisters Cyneburh and Cyneswith
do sanction the same.” “And I Deusdedit,
Archbishop of Canterbury, do confirm the
same.” Then all the others who were there
confirmed this grant with the cross of Christ;
these were by name Ithamar Bishop of Rochester,
and Wine Bishop of London, and Jeruman
Bishop of the Mercians, and Bishop Tuda, and
the Priest Wilfrid, who was afterwards a Bishop,
and the Priest Eoppa whom King Wulfere sent
to preach Christianity in Wight, and the Abbot
Saxulf, and the Aldermen Immine, Eadberht,
Herefield, Wilberht, and Abon, and Æthelbold,
Brordan, Wilberht, Ælhmund, and Frethegis.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>These and many others, the King’s chief men, all
confirmed the grant. This writing was made in
the year 664 after the birth of our Lord, in the
7th year of King Wulfere, and the 9th of the
Archbishop Deusdedit. Then they laid the
curse of God, and that of all the Saints, and of
all Christian people upon him who should undo
any thing that was now done: “So be it,” said
all, “Amen.” When this transaction was
finished the King sent to Rome, to Vitalianus the
Pope that then was, and entreated that he would
confirm all the aforesaid proceeding with his rescript
and with his blessing. And the Pope sent
his rescript, saying thus, “I Vitalianus the Pope
do grant unto thee King Wulfere, and unto the
Archbishop Deusdedit, and unto the Abbot
Saxulf, all things that ye desire; and I forbid the
King or any man whatsoever to have any claim
thereon, excepting the Abbot only, neither let
him be subject to any excepting the Pope of
Rome, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. If
any man break this ordinance in any thing, let St.
Peter with his sword destroy him: whosoever
observeth it, let St. Peter with his key open unto
him the kingdom of heaven.” Thus was founded
the monastery of Medeshamstede, which was afterwards
called Burh (Peterborough). Afterwards,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>another Archbishop came to Canterbury; he was
named Theodore, a very wise and a good man,
and he held his synod with his Bishops and the
Clergy. Then Winfrid Bishop of Mercia was
deprived of his See, and the Abbot Saxulf was
chosen thereto, and Cuthbald, a monk of the
same monastery, was made Abbot. This synod
was held 673 years after the birth of Christ.</p>


<p class="center">658.</p>

<p>This year Cenwalh fought with the Welsh at
Pen, and drove them to the Parret. This battle
was fought after he came from East Anglia: He
was there three years, for Penda had driven him
into exile because he had divorced his sister.</p>


<p class="center">660.</p>

<p>This year Bishop Æthelbryht departed from
Cenwalh, and Wine held the Bishoprick three
years. And Æthelbryht received the see of Paris
on the Seine in Gaul.</p>


<p class="center">661.</p>

<p>This year at Easter Cenwalh fought at Possenbyrig
(Pontesbury, Shropshire), and Wulfere the
son of Penda laid waste the country as far as
Æsces-dune (Aston, Berkshire?). And Cuthred
the son of Cwichelm and King Cenbyrht died in
the same year. And Wulfere the son of Penda
ravaged Wight and gave the island to Æthelwald
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>King of the South Saxons, because he (Wulfere)
was his godfather: and the priest Eoppa by the
desire of Wilverd and of King Wulfere first
brought baptism to the inhabitants of Wight.</p>


<p class="center">664.</p>

<p>This year the Sun was eclipsed. And Arcenbryht
King of Kent died, and his son Ecbyrht
succeeded him. And Colman<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> with his companions
went to his own country. And this year
there was a great pestilence in Britain, whereof
Bishop Tuda died and he was buried at Wagele.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
And Ceadda and Wilverth were consecrated. And
the same year the Archbishop Deusdedit died.</p>


<p class="center">667.</p>

<p>This year Oswiu and Ecbriht sent the priest
Wigheard to Rome that he might be consecrated
as Archbishop of Canterbury, but he died as
soon as he arrived there.</p>


<p class="center">668.</p>

<p>This year Theodore was consecrated Archbishop
and sent to England.</p>


<p class="center">669.</p>

<p>This year King Ecbyrht gave Raculf (Reculver)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>to the priest Basse that he might there build
a monastery.</p>


<p class="center">670.</p>

<p>This year Osweo King of the Northumbrians
died on the 15th of the calends of March, and his
son Ecverth reigned after him. And Hlothere
the nephew of Bishop Æthelbyrht received the
Bishoprick of Wessex, and held it 7 years;
Bishop Theodore consecrated him. And Osweo
was the son of Æthelverth, Æthelverth of Æthelric,
Æthelric of Ida, Ida of Eoppa.</p>


<p class="center">671.</p>

<p>This year there was a great slaughter of birds.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a></p>


<p class="center">672.</p>

<p>This year King Cenwalh died, and his Queen
Seaxburh held the kingdom one year after him.</p>


<p class="center">673.</p>

<p>This year Ecbryht King of Kent died, and
the same year there was a synod at Hertford.—And
St. Ætheldryth began the monastery at Ely.</p>


<p class="center">674.</p>

<p>This year Æscwine succeeded to the kingdom
of Wessex, he was the son of Cenfus, Cenfus of
Cenferth, Cenferth of Cuthgils, Cuthgils of Ceolwulf,
Ceolwulf of Cynric, Cynric of Cerdic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p class="center">675.</p>

<p>This year Wulfere the son of Penda, and
Æscwine the son of Cenfus, fought at Bedanheafd
(Bedwin, Wiltshire?) And the same year
Wulfere died, and Æthelred succeeded to the
kingdom. He sent Bishop Wilfrid to Rome, to
the Pope that then was, named Agatho, and informed
him by letter and by a message, how his
brethren Peada and Wulfere had builded a monastery,
which was called Medeshamstede, and
that they had freed the same from all subjection
to King or Bishop, and he desired that the Pope
would confirm this with his rescript and with his
blessing. Then the Pope sent a letter to England,
saying thus, “I Agatho, Pope of Rome,
greet well the worshipful Æthelred King of Mercia,
and Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Saxulf Bishop of Mercia, who before was
Abbot, and all the Abbots in England, with the
salutation of God, and my blessing. I have heard
the desire of King Æthelred, and of the Archbishop
Theodore, and of the bishop Saxulf, and
of the Abbot Cuthbald, and I will that it be in all
wise, even as ye have spoken. And I command,
on behalf of God and of St. Peter, and of all the
Saints, and of all consecrated persons, that
neither King, Bishop, Earl, nor any man, receive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>any duty, tax, tribute, or farthing, and that
none claim any service of any kind from the
abbacy of Medeshamstede. I command also that
the Bishop of the Shire presume not to perform
either ordination or consecration within this abbacy,
unless the Abbot desire it of him; neither
may he claim any bishop’s or synod’s fine, nor
receive therefrom any returns of any kind. I will
also that the Abbot be held as the Legate of
Rome over all the island, and that whosoever
may be chosen by the monks be consecrated by
the Archbishop of Canterbury. I will and enact,
if any man have made a vow to go to Rome,
which he may not be able to perform, either from
sickness, from his Lord’s need of him, from
poverty, or from any other cause, that he, be he
of England or of any other island, repair to the
monastery of Medeshamstede, and he shall receive
the same absolution from Christ and St. Peter,
from the Abbot and from the Monks, that he
would have if he went to Rome. Now I desire
thee, brother Theodore, that thou cause it to be
proclaimed throughout England, that a synod be
assembled, and that this letter be read and observed.
I say also to thee, Bishop Saxulf,
that as thou desirest that this monastery should
be free, so I forbid thee, and all Bishops sent of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>Christ and of his Saints, who come after thee, to
receive any gain from the monastery, excepting
that which pleaseth the Abbot. Now will I say
this in words, that whosoever observeth this rescript
and this commandment, he shall dwell for
ever with Almighty God in the kingdom of
heaven, and whosoever breaketh it, he shall be
excommunicated and condemned to punishment
with Judas and with all the devils in hell, unless
he come to repentance. Amen.” Pope Agatho
and 120 Bishops sent this letter to England by
Wilfrid Archbishop of York. This was done
680 years after the birth of our Lord, in the 6th
year of King Æthelred. Then the King commanded
Archbishop Theodore that he should
appoint a meeting of all the Witan at the place
which is called Heatfeld (Hatfield). When
they were there assembled, then he caused the
letter, which the Pope had sent thither, to be
read, and they all confirmed the same, and fully
ratified it. Then said the King, “All things
that my brother Peada, and my brother Wulfere,
and my sisters Cyneburh and Cyneswith, gave
and secured to St. Peter and to the Abbot, I will
that these stand; and I will in my day increase
the gift for the sake of their souls and of mine
own. Now give I this day to St. Peter and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>his monastery of Medeshamstede these lands,
and all thereunto belonging: to wit, Bredune,
Hrepingas, Cedenac, Swines-hæfed (Swineshead),
Heanbyrig, Lodeshac, Scuffanhalch, Costesford,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>
Stretford, Wætelle-burne, Lufgeard,
Æthelhuniglond, Barthan-ig (Bardney), These
lands I give to St. Peter all as freely as I myself
possessed them, and so that none of my successors
may take any thing therefrom. If any do
this let him have the curse of the Pope of Rome,
and the curse of all Bishops, and of all who are
here as witnesses; and I confirm this with the sign
of Christ.” ♰ “And I Theodore Archbishop of
Canterbury am witness to this charter of Medeshamstede,
and I confirm it with my own hand-writing,
and I excommunicate all those who may
break any part thereof, and I bless all who shall
observe it.” ♰ “I Wilfrid Archbishop of York
am witness to this writing, and I confirm the
said curse.” ♰ “I Saxulf, who was first Abbot
and am now Bishop, do lay my curse and that
of all my successors upon those who may break
it.” “I Ostrithe Queen of Æthelred do sanction
the grant.” “I Adrian the Legate assent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>to the same.” “I Putta Bishop of Rochester
subscribe to it.” “I Waldhere Bishop of London
confirm it.” “I the Abbot Cuthbald do
establish the same, so that whosoever breaketh
it let him take the curse of all Bishops, and of
all Christian people.” Amen.</p>


<p class="center">676.</p>

<p>This year Æscwine died and Hedda succeeded
to the bishoprick (of Winchester) and Centwine
to the kingdom of Wessex. Centwine was the
son of Cynegils, Cynegils of Ceolwulf. And
Æthelred King of Mercia overran Kent.</p>


<p class="center">678.</p>

<p>This year a comet appeared in August, and
shone like a sun-beam every morning for three
months. And Bishop Wilfrith was driven from
his see by King Ecgverth, and two Bishops were

<p class="center">680.</p>

<p>This year Theodore convoked an Archiepiscopal
Synod at Hatfield, that he might set forth
aright the Christian faith. And the same year
died Hilda Abbess of Streones-heale (Whitby).</p>


<p class="center">681.</p>

<p>This year Trumbriht was consecrated Bishop
of Hagulstades-ea (Hexham), and Trumwine as

Britons to the sea.</p>


<p class="center">684.</p>

<p>This year Ecgferth sent an army against the
Scots, and Briht his Alderman therewith, and
they lamentably plundered and burned the

<p class="center">685.</p>

<p>This year King Ecgferth commanded that
Cuthberht should be made a Bishop, and Archbishop
Theodore consecrated him at York, on
the first day of Easter, as Bishop of Hexham,
for Trumbriht had been deprived of that see.
And the same year on the 13th of the calends of
June King Ecgferth was slain by the north sea,
and a great army with him. He reigned 15
years, and his brother Aldfrith succeeded him:
this Ecgferth was the son of Osweo, Osweo of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>Æthelverth, Æthelverth of Æthelric, Æthelric
of Ida, Ida of Eoppa. This year Ceadwalla
began to contend for the kingdom, he was the
son of Cenbyrht, Cenbyrht of Cada, Cada of
Cutha, Cutha of Ceawlin, Ceawlin of Cynric,
Cynric of Cerdic, and Mul was the brother of
Ceadwalla, and he was afterwards burned in Kent.
And Hlothere King of Kent died the same year.
And John was consecrated to the bishoprick of
Hexham, and he kept possession of it till Wilfrith
returned, and afterwards, on the death of
Bishop Bosa, John received the bishoprick of
York, and his priest Wilferth was afterwards
consecrated to the bishoprick of York, and he
retired to his monastery in Derawuda (Beverley).
This year it rained blood in Britain, and milk
and butter were turned into blood.</p>


<p class="center">686.</p>

<p>This year Ceadwalla and his brother Mul laid
waste Kent and Wight; this Ceadwalla gave to
St. Peter’s monastery of Medeshamstede a valley
in a certain island called Heabureahg, the name
of the Abbot of the monastery at this time was
Egbalth, he was the third after Saxulf, Theodore
being then Archbishop of Kent.</p>


<p class="center">687.</p>

<p>This year Mul was burned in Kent, and 12
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>others with him; and this year Ceadwalla again
ravaged Kent.</p>


<p class="center">688.</p>

<p>This year King Ceadwalla went to Rome and
received baptism from Pope Sergius, who gave
him the name of Peter, and he died while he
was yet in his baptismal garments, about seven
days afterwards, on the 12th of the calends of
May, and he was buried in St. Peter’s Church.
And Ina succeeded him in the kingdom of Wessex,
and reigned 37 years, and he built the
monastery of Glastonbury, and he afterwards
went to Rome, and abode there unto the end of
his days. Ina was the son of Cenred, Cenred of
Ceolwald, Ceolwald was the brother of Cynigils,
and they were both the sons of Cuthred the son
of Ceawlin, Ceawlin was the son of Cynric,
Cynric of Cerdic.</p>


<p class="center">690.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Theodore died, he was
a Bishop 12 years, and he was buried at Canterbury,
and Beorhtwald succeeded to the Archbishoprick
on the calends of July; he was before
Abbot of Reculver. Before this time the Bishops
had been Romans, and afterwards they were English.
There were then two Kings in Kent,
Wihtred and Wæbheard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p class="center">693.</p>

<p>This year Brihtwald was consecrated Archbishop
by the Gallican Bishop Godwin, on the
5th of the nones of July. At this time died
Gifemund Bishop of Rochester, and Archbishop
Brihtwald consecrated Tobias to his bishoprick.
About this time Brihtelm also died.</p>


<p class="center">694.</p>

<p>This year the men of Kent made a treaty with
Ina, and gave thirty thousand pounds for his
friendship, because they had burned his brother
Mul. And Wihtred succeeded to the kingdom
of Kent and held it 33 years; this Wihtred was
the son of Ecgbyrht, Ecgbyrht of Arcenbyrht,
Arcenbyrht of Eadbald, Eadbald of Æthelbyrht.
And as soon as he was King he caused a great
council to be convened at the place called
Baccancelde (Beckenham, Kent?); and there
Wihtred King of Kent, and Brihtwald Archbishop
of Canterbury and Tobias Bishop of
Rochester, with Abbots and Abbesses, and many
wise men were gathered together, all to consult
upon the restoration of the churches of
God in Kent. Now the King began to speak,
and he said, “I will that all the monasteries and
churches that were given and bequeathed to the
glory of God in the days of faithful Kings my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>predecessors, and in the days of my kinsman
King Æthelberht and of those who followed
after him, do so remain dedicated to the glory of
God, and that they continue thus evermore to
eternity. Forasmuch as I Wihtred an earthly
King, incited by the King of Heaven, and burning
with zeal for righteousness, have learned this
of our forefathers, that no layman has the right
to obtrude himself into any church or into any
thing that belongeth to the church, this therefore
we strictly and unreservedly establish and ordain,
and in the name of Almighty God, and of all the
Saints, we forbid all Kings our successors, and
Aldermen, and all laymen, to hold any lordship
whatever over the churches, or over any of the
possessions which I or my predecessors in former
days have given them, as an everlasting inheritance
to the glory of Christ, and of our Lady
St. Mary, and of the holy Apostles. And observe
that when it shall happen that a Bishop or
an Abbot or an Abbess departeth this life, it shall
be told to the Archbishop, and with his counsel
and advice let him that is worthy be elected, and
let the Archbishop inquire into the life and virtues
of him who is chosen to so high an office,
and in no wise let any one be chosen or consecrated
thereto without the Archbishop’s sanction.
Kings shall create Earls and Aldermen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>Sheriffs and Judges, and the Archbishop shall
govern and direct the church of God, and shall
choose and appoint Bishops, Abbots, Abbesses,
Priests, and Deacons, and shall consecrate them
and confirm them by good precepts and example,
lest any of God’s flock stray and be lost.”</p>


<p class="center">695.</p>

the kingdom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p class="center">709.</p>

<p>This year died Bishop Aldhelm, whose diocese
lay around Westan-wuda (Westwood, Wiltshire).
In the early days of Bishop Daniel the land of
the West Saxons was divided into two bishopricks,

deprived his kinsman Sigebryht for his unrighteous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>deeds of all his kingdom, excepting Hampshire,
and Sigebryht kept that, till he had slain
the Alderman who had adhered to him the longest,
and then Cynewulf drove him into Andred, and
he remained there until a certain peasant stabbed
him at Pruutes-flod (Privet, Hampshire) and
avenged the Alderman Cumbran. And Cynewulf
often fought great battles with the Britons. And
about 31 years from his accession to the kingdom
he sought to banish a Prince called Cyneheard:
this Cyneheard was the brother of Sigebryht, and
he found that the King was gone with a small train
to visit a lady at Meran-tun (Merton, Surrey), and
there he beset him, and blocked up the house before
the men who were with the King discovered
him; and when the king perceived this, he went to
the door, and defended himself manfully until he
beheld the Prince, and then he rushed out upon
him, and wounded him severely, upon which
they all fought against the King until they slew
him. When the King’s Thanes who were in the
house heard the tumult, they ran thither, every
one armed as he was. And immediately the
Prince offered money and their lives to each of
them, but none would compound with him, and
they fought against him until they all fell, save
one, a British hostage, and he was sorely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>wounded. In the morning when the King’s
Thanes, who had remained behind, heard that
the King was slain, they rode thither, both his
Alderman Osric and his Thane Wiverth, and
all those whom he had left; and they found the
Prince in the town wherein the King lay slain,
and the gates shut against them. And when they
came up he promised them their liberty, and
riches, and lands, if they would give up the
kingdom to him; and he told them that their
kinsmen were with him, and would not desert
him. Then they answered, that no kinsman
was dearer to them than their Lord, and that
they would never follow his murderer, and they
bade their kinsmen abandon the Prince, and
depart in safety. These replied, that the same
offer had been made to their adversaries the former
companions of the King, and that they were
no more inclined to do this thing than their own
fellow soldiers who with the King had been
slain. And then they fought around the gates
until the Prince’s party fled into the town, and
the Prince was killed, and all who were with him
except one; he was godson of the Alderman
who saved his life, though he had many wounds.
Cynewulf reigned 31 years, and his body lieth at
Winchester, and that of the Prince at Acsanmynster
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>(Axminster), and their father’s race

Eanwulf of Osmod, Osmod of Eawa, Eawa
of Wybba, Wybba of Creoda, Creoda of Cynewald,
Cynewald of Cnebba, Cnebba of Icel, Icel
of Eomær, Eomær of Angeltheow, Angeltheow of

Bynsintun (Benshington or Benson, Oxfordshire),

Offa there was an Abbot of Medeshamstede named
Beonne, and this Beonne, by the advice of all
the monks of that monastery, let the lands of ten
bondsmen at Swineshead to the Alderman Cuthbriht,
with the pastures and meads, and all that
lieth adjoining, on condition that Cuthbriht
should give the Abbot 50 pounds for the same,
and every year one night’s lodging or 30 shillings
in pence, and also that the land should return to

monastery of Wocingas (Wickins, Northamptonshire)
because he desired to give it to Medeshamstede,
and to St. Peter, and to the Abbot that
then was; this was Pusa, the successor of Beonne,
and the King loved him much. And the King
freed the monastery of Wickins from service due
to King, Bishop, Earl, or any other man, so that
none but St. Peter and the Abbot should have
any claims thereon. This was done in the King’s
town called Freoric-burn.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>ten years. “Charles entered Spain. Charles
came into Saxony. Charles destroyed the cities
of Pampeluna and Saragossa; he gathered together
his forces, and after receiving hostages,

the daughter of Offa. And in his days

(Denmark), they were three in number.
And the Sheriff rode up to them and would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>driven their crews to the king’s town, for that he

<p class="center">793.</p>

<p>This year terrible prodigies took place in
Northumberland, and sorely alarmed the people,
these were dreadful lightnings and fiery dragons
which were seen flying in the air; a great famine

whole synod, and of the monasteries to which freedom
was granted by faithful men in former days,
and by the command of Pope Leo, do require in
the name of God, and under pain of his fearful
judgment, that henceforth no man daringly choose
Lords over the heritage of God from amongst
laymen. And even as it is commanded in the
rescripts which the Pope had given, and as the
holy men our fathers and teachers have appointed
touching the sacred monasteries, so let it remain
inviolate without gainsaying. If there be any
man who will not observe this decree of God,
and of our Pope, and of ourselves, but despiseth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>it and setteth it at nought, let such know that they
shall be called to account before the judgment
seat of God. And I Archbishop Athelard, with
12 Bishops and 23 Abbots, do confirm and ratify
the same with the sign of the cross of Christ.”</p>


<p class="center">797.</p>

at Hengest-dune (Hengston-hill) and there he put
to flight both the Welsh and the Danes.</p>


<p class="center">836.</p>

<p>This year King Egbryht died. Before he was
King, Offa King of Mercia and Borhtric King
of Wessex had driven him out of England into
France for three years, Beorhtric aiding Offa
because he had his daughter for his Queen;
and Egbryht afterwards returned again, and
reigned 37 years and 7 months. And Æthelwulf
the son of Egbryht succeeded to the kingdom
of Wessex, and he (Egbryht?<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>) gave his
son Æthelstan the kingdoms of Kent and Essex,
and that of Surrey and Sussex.</p>


<p class="center">837.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Wulfheard fought
with 33 pirate ships at Southampton, and there he

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>year Duke Æthelhelm and the Dorset men
fought with the Danish army in Port (Portland),
and had the advantage for some time, but the
Danes kept possession of the field of battle, and
slew the Alderman.</p>


<p class="center">838.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Herebryht and many
others with him were slain by the heathens, in the
marshes (near Romne). And again, the same
year, many were slain by this army in Lindsey,
East Anglia, and Kent.</p>


<p class="center">839.</p>

<p class="center">845.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Eanwulf with the men
of Somerset, and Bishop Ealchstan, and the Alderman

<p class="center">851.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Ceorl and the men of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>Devon fought with a heathen army at Wicganbeorch
(Wembury, near Plymouth), and there
they made great slaughter and won the victory.
And the same year King Æthelstan and Duke
Ealchere fought in ships, and slew a great number
(of Danes), near Sandwich, in Kent, and
they took nine ships, and put the rest to flight.
Then the heathens first remained through the
winter in Thanet. And the same year 350 ships
came to the mouth of the Thames, and the men
landed and stormed Canterbury and London, and
put to flight Beorhtulf King of the Mercians
and his army. And then they went southward
over the Thames into Surrey, and King Æthelwulf
and his son Æthelbald, with the West
Saxon forces, fought with them at Aclea (Okeley),
and there they made the greatest slaughter
of these heathens that we have ever heard of unto
this present day, and there they gained the victory.</p>


<p class="center">852.</p>

<p>This year Ceolred Abbot of Medeshamstede
and the monks let the land of Sempigaham (Sempringham)
to Wulfred, on condition that it
should return to the monastery after his death,
and that Wulfred should give the land of Sliowaford
(Sleaford) unto Medeshamstede, and that he
should give every year to the monastery 60 fother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>of wood, and 12 fother of coals, and 6 fother of
turf, and 2 tuns full of clear ale, and two slain
oxen, and 600 loaves, and 10 measures of Welch
ale, also a horse every year, and 30 shillings, and
one night’s lodging. King Burhred, Archbishop
Ceolred, the Bishops Tunberht, Ceured, Alhhim,
and Berhtred, the Abbots Wihtred and
Werhtherd, and the Aldermen Æthelheard and
Hunberht, and many others were witnesses
thereof.</p>


<p class="center">853.</p>

<p>This year Burhred King of Mercia and his
Witan entreated King Æthelwulf that he would
assist them in bringing the North Welshmen into
subjection, and he did so, for he marched with
an army through Mercia into North Wales, and
they all submitted to him. And the same year
King Æthelwulf sent his son Alfred to Rome.
Leo was then Pope, and he consecrated him as
King, and took him for his Godson. The same
year Ealhere with the men of Kent, and Huda
with those of Surrey, fought with a heathen army
in Thanet, and at first they were victorious, and
many were there slain and drowned on either side,
and both the Aldermen were killed. And Burhred
King of Mercia married the daughter of
Æthelwulf King of Wessex.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p class="center">854.</p>

<p>This year the heathens first remained through
the winter in Sheppey. And the same year King
Æthelwulf made a grant of the tithe of his lands
throughout all his kingdom, for the love of God
and for his own soul’s eternal welfare. And this
year he went to Rome with much pomp, and he
abode there 12 months; then he journeyed homeward,
and Charles King of France gave him his
daughter named Leothete for his Queen; and after
this he came to his people, and they rejoiced thereat.
And in about 2 years from the time he came into
France, he died, and his body lieth at Winchester;
he reigned 18 years and a half. This Æthelwulf
was the son of Egbyrht, Egbyrht of Ealhmund,
Ealhmund of Eafa, Eafa of Eoppa,
Eoppa of Ingild, Ingild was the brother of Ina
King of Wessex, who held his kingdom 37 years,
and afterwards went to St. Peter and ended his
life at Rome: they were the sons of Cenred,
Genred of Ceolwald, Ceolwald of Cutha, Cutha
of Cuthwine, Cuthwine of Ceawlin, Ceawlin of
Cynric, Cynric of Creoda, Creoda of Cerdic,
Cerdic was the son of Elesa, Elesa of Esla, Esla

in the ark; Lamech, Methusalem, Enoch, Jared,
Malalahed, Cainion, Enos, Seth, Adam <i>primus
homo et Pater noster, id est, Christus</i>, Amen.—Then
the two sons of Æthelwulf succeeded him,
Æthelbald in the kingdom of Wessex, and
Æthelbryht in the kingdoms of Kent, of Essex,
and of Surrey and Sussex. Æthelbald reigned
5 years. Æthelwulf had sent his third son Alfred
to Rome, and when the Pope heard that he was
dead, he consecrated Alfred as King, and was
godfather at his confirmation, even as his father
Æthelwulf had desired when he sent him thither.</p>


<p class="center">860.</p>

<p>This year King Æthelbald died, and his body
lieth at Sherborn, and his brother Æthelbryht
succeeded to all his kingdom, and he held it in
goodly concord and great peacefulness. And in
his days a large army landed and stormed Winchester,
and the Alderman Osric with the men
of Hampshire, and the Alderman Æthelwulf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>with the Berkshire men, fought with them and
put them to flight, and kept possession of the
field of battle. And this Æthelbryht reigned 5
years, and his body lieth at Sherborn.</p>


<p class="center">861.</p>

<p>This year the Bishop St. Swithin died.</p>


<p class="center">865.</p>

<p>This year the heathen army remained in
Thanet, and made a treaty with the Kentishmen,
who promised them money for peace. And
under this treaty and promise of money, they
stole out by night and plundered all the eastern
parts of Kent.</p>


<p class="center">866.</p>

<p>This year Æthered the brother of Æthelbyrht
succeeded to the kingdom of Wessex. And
the same year a great army of heathens came to
England, and took up their winter quarters among
the East Angles, and there they were supplied
with horses, and the people made peace with
them.</p>


<p class="center">867.</p>

<p>This year the invading army went from East
Anglia across the mouth of the Humber to York
in Northumberland; and there was much discord
amongst the people themselves there, for they
had cast off their King Osbryht, and had taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>Ælla, an alien, for their King. But late in the
year the two parties joined, and both fought
against the army; and they gathered together a
great force, and came upon the invaders at York,
and some of them broke into the town, and then
there was a very great slaughter of the Northumbrians,
some being slain within the town and
some without, and both the Kings were killed,
and those who survived made peace with the
army. The same year died Bishop Ealchstan,
he held the bishoprick of Sherborn 50 years, and
his body lieth in that town.</p>


<p class="center">868.</p>

<p>This year the same army came into Mercia as far
as Nottingham, and took up their winter quarters
there, and Burhred King of Mercia and his
Witan begged Æthered King of Wessex and his
brother Alfred to assist them, that they might
fight against this army. And then they came
with the West Saxon troops into Mercia and to
Nottingham, and they found them within the
fortress, and besieged them, and there was no
battle of moment, and the Mercians made peace
with the army.</p>


<p class="center">869.</p>

<p>This year the army went again to York, and
remained there one year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p class="center">870.</p>

<p>This year the heathen army rode over Mercia
into East Anglia, and took up their winter quarters
at Thetford. And in the winter the King St.
Edmund fought with them, and the Danes gained
the victory, and slew the King, and they subjected
all that land, and destroyed all the monasteries
to which they came. The names of their
chiefs who slew the King were Higwais and
Ubba. At the same time they came to Medeshamstede,
which they burned and pulled down.
They slew the Abbot and the monks and all
whom they found there; and that place which
before was very rich, they brought to possess nothing.
And the same year Archbishop Ceolnoth
died, and Æthered Bishop of Wiltshire was
translated to the see of Canterbury.</p>


<p class="center">871.</p>

<p>This year the army came to Reading, in Wessex,
and in about three days, two of their Earls
rode forth, and the Alderman Æthelwulf met
them at Englefield, and fought with them and
won the victory, and one of them whose name
was Sidrac was slain. Then in about four days
King Æthered and his brother Alfred led a great
force to Reading, and fought with the army, and
there was much slaughter on both sides, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>Alderman Æthelwulf was killed, and the Danes
remained masters of the field. And about four
days from that time King Æthered and his brother
Alfred fought with all the army at Æcesdun,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a>
and the Danes were overcome; they had
two heathen Kings Bagsæc and Healfden, and
many Earls, and they were in two divisions, the
Kings Bagsæc and Healfden commanded the one,
and the Earls headed the other. King Æthered
fought with the division under the Kings and
Bagsæc was slain, and his brother Alfred with
that of the Earls, and Earl Sidroc<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> the elder,
and Earl Sidroc the younger, and Earl Osbearn,
and Earl Fræna, and Earl Hareld were killed;
and then both divisions fled, and many thousands
were slain, and they continued fighting until
night. And in about a fortnight King Æthered
and his brother Alfred fought with the army at
Basing, and there the Danes gained the victory.
And about two months afterwards King Æthered
and his brother Alfred fought at Mere-tun,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>this army which was in two divisions, and they
had the advantage over both during great part of
the day, but there was much slaughter on either
side, and the Danes remained masters of the
field, and Bishop Heahmund and many good men
were slain there. And after this fight a great
summer<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> pestilence came upon Reading. And
King Æthered died after Easter; he reigned five
years, and his body lieth at Winborn Minster.
His brother Alfred the son of Æthelwulf succeeded
to the kingdom of Wessex, and in about
a month, he and a small number of men fought with
all the army at Wilton, and had the advantage
great part of the day, but the Danes kept possession
of the field of battle. And this year nine
battles were fought in that kingdom, south
of the Thames; and, besides these, the King’s
brother Alfred, and the Aldermen and the King’s
Thanes rode forth separately against the Danes,
times out of number. And this year nine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>Earls and a King were slain: and the same
year the men of Wessex made peace with the
army.</p>


<p class="center">872.</p>

<p>This year the army went from Reading to London,
and there took up their winter quarters, and
the Mercians made peace with them.</p>


<p class="center">873.</p>

<p>This year the army went into Northumberland,
and they took up their winter quarters at Torksey,
in Lindsey: then the Mercians again made
peace with them.</p>


<p class="center">874.</p>

<p>This year the army proceeded from Lindsey
to Repton, and there they took up their winter
quarters. And they drove King Burhred over
sea, about twenty-two years from the time that he
had begun to reign. And they conquered all that
country. And King Burhred went to Rome and
abode there unto the end of his life, and his body
lieth in St. Mary’s Church, in the school of the
English nation. The same year they gave the
kingdom of Mercia to Ceolwulf, an unwise Thane
of the King, that he should hold it; and he
swore oaths to them and gave hostages that the
kingdom should be at their command, on whatsoever
day they might wish to have it again, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>that he himself and all his subjects should be
ready to aid the army.</p>


<p class="center">875.</p>

<p>This year the army departed from Repton;
and Healfden went with part of the troops into
Northumberland, and wintered by the river Tyne;
and this division conquered that land, and made
many inroads upon the Picts and the Strathclyde
Britons. And the three Kings, Godrun,
Oscytel, and Anwind, went from Repton to Cambridge
with a large army, and abode there one
year. And this summer King Alfred went out
to sea with a fleet, and fought with seven pirate
ships, and took one of them, and put the rest to
flight.</p>


<p class="center">876.</p>

<p>This year Rodla (Rollo), with his forces, overran
Normandy; he reigned 50 years. And this
year the Danes marched secretly into Wareham
in Wessex, and afterwards the King made peace
with that army, and they gave the noblest amongst
them as hostages, and swore oaths to him on the
holy bracelet<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> (which they would never do for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>any nation before), that they would forthwith depart
from his kingdom. Yet under these engagements
their horse stole off by night to Exeter.
And the same year Healfden parcelled out
Northumberland, and they ploughed and tilled it.</p>


<p class="center">877.</p>

<p>This year the army came from Wareham into
Exeter, and the fleet sailed round to the west,
and a great storm met them at sea, and 120 ships
were wrecked at Swanwich. And King Alfred
with his troops rode after the Danish horse as far
as Exeter, but they could not come up with them
before they were in the fortress where none might
assail them. And they gave him hostages, as
many as he would, and swore solemn oaths, and
they kept this peace well. Then in the autumn
the army went into Mercia, and they parcelled
out part of the land (amongst themselves), and
they gave part to Ceolwulf.</p>


<p class="center">878.</p>

<p>This year at mid-winter the army marched
secretly to Chippenham after Twelfth night, and
they overran Wessex, and they fixed themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>there, and drove many of the inhabitants over
sea, and they rode forth against most of those
who remained, until all had submitted to them
excepting King Alfred, and he with a small
party hardly escaped into the woods and the hill
fastnesses. The same winter the brother of Inwær
and Healfden came with 23 ships to Devonshire
in Wessex, and he was slain there, and 840
men with him; and the sacred standard, which
they called the raven, was taken. And at Easter
King Alfred, with his small band, raised a fortress
at Æthelinga-igge (Athelney) and thence
he made sallies upon the army, together with the
men of Somerset who were nearest to him.—Then
in the seventh week after Easter he rode to
Ecgbyrhtes-stan (Brixton) east of Selwood, and
there all the men of Somerset and Wiltshire and
Hampshire, all who were on this side the sea,
met him, and were rejoiced to see him. And
after one night he went from that village to Iglea
(Leigh), and thence again after another night
to Æthan-dun (Edindon), and there he fought
with the whole army, and he put the Danes to
flight, and pursued them as far as their fortress,
and he remained there a fortnight. And then the
army gave him hostages, with solemn oaths that
they would depart from his kingdom, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>promised that their King should receive baptism,
which also was performed. And in about
three weeks King Godrun, with some thirty men,
the noblest in the army, came to him at Aire
which is near Athelney, and the King stood
godfather at his baptism, and he put off the
Chrisom-cloth at Wetmor (Wedmor), and he
was twelve days with the King, who honoured
him and his companions with great presents.</p>


<p class="center">879.</p>

<p>This year the army went from Chippenham to
Cirencester, and remained there one year: and
this year a body of pirates was gathered together
and settled at Fulham on the Thames. And the
same year the sun was eclipsed for one hour in
the day. And the army went from Cirencester
into East Anglia, and fixed themselves in that
land, and divided it. And the same year the
army which was before at Fulham went over sea
to Ghent in France, and abode there one year.</p>


<p class="center">881.</p>

<p>This year the army went over to France, and
the French fought with these invaders, and the
army horsed itself after that battle.</p>


<p class="center">882.</p>

<p>This year the army went up along the Maese
far into France, and remained there one year.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>And the same year King Alfred went out to
sea, and fought with four Danish pirate ships,
and he took two of them, the men therein being
slain, and two yielded to him, but many of
the men were cut down and wounded before they
would surrender themselves.</p>


<p class="center">883.</p>

<p>This year the army proceeded up the Scheldt
to Condé, and abode there one year. And the
great Pope Marinus sent a piece of our Lord’s
cross to King Alfred. And this year Sighelm
and Athelstan carried to Rome the alms which
King Alfred had vowed to send thither, and
also into India, to St. Thomas and to St. Bartholomew.
Then troops were posted at London
to oppose the army, and, thanks to God, they
were very successful after these vows.</p>


<p class="center">884.</p>

<p>This year the army went up the Somme to
Amiens, and remained there one year. This
year died the good Bishop Athelwold.</p>


<p class="center">885.</p>

<p>This year the aforesaid army divided itself into
two parts, one division went eastward,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> the other
proceeded to Rochester, and besieged that town:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>and they built another fortress over against it,
yet the inhabitants defended the place until King
Alfred came out with his troops. Then the army
went to the ships and deserted the fortress, and
the king’s men were supplied with horses; and
soon after, in the course of the same summer, the
Danes departed again over sea. And the same
year King Alfred sent a fleet from Kent to East
Anglia. As soon as they came to the mouth of
the Stour, they met 16 pirate ships, and they
gave them battle immediately, and they took all
the ships and slew the men, but as they were returning
homeward with the booty, they met a large
fleet of pirates, and they fought with them also
the same day, and the Danes gained the victory.
Charles King of France died this year, he was
killed by a wild boar. And his brother also who
reigned over the Western Empire had died one
year before; and they were both sons of Louis
who held the Western Empire, and who died
the year in which the sun was eclipsed; he
was the son of that Charles whose daughter
Æthelwulf King of Wessex had to wife. And
the same year a large fleet was gathered together
among the Old Saxons,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> and there were two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>great fights, and the Saxons gained the victory,
and the Frisians were with them. This year
Charles succeeded to the Western Empire, comprehending
all the lands, exclusive of Britanny,
from the Wendel sea (the Mediterranean) unto
this sea, even as his great grandfather had
possessed them: this Charles was the son of
Louis, the brother of Charles the father of Judith
whom Æthelwulf King of Wessex had to
wife; these were the sons of Louis, and he was
the son of Charles the elder, and Charles was the
son of Pepin. And the same year died the good
Pope Marinus, who freed the school of the
English nation from tribute at the desire of King
Alfred, and who sent him great gifts, and holy
relics, and a piece of the cross on which Christ
suffered. And this year the army in East Anglia
broke the peace with King Alfred.</p>


<p class="center">886.</p>

<p>This year the army, which before had bent
its course eastward, turned again to the west;
and they went up the Seine, and fixed their winter
quarters at the city of Paris. The same year
King Alfred repaired London, and all the English
people who were free from the bondage of
the Danes came over to him, and he committed
the city to the care of the Alderman Æthered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p class="center">887.</p>

<p>This year the army went over the bridge at
Paris, and thence along the Seine unto the Marne,
and then up the Marne to Caziei (Choisy?)
and they fixed themselves there, and in Yonne,
spending two winters in these two stations.—And
the same year died Charles King of
France; his brother’s son Earnulf had deprived
him of the kingdom six weeks before his death.
Then was that kingdom divided into five parts,
and five Kings were consecrated thereto; yet
this was done with the consent of Earnulf, and
they said that they would hold their kingdoms
at his hand, because none of them were claimants
on the father’s side, excepting him alone. Then
Earnulf dwelt in the country east of the Rhine;
and Hrothulf took the middle kingdom; and Oda
the western parts; and Beorngar and Witha took
Lombardy, and the lands on that side of the
mountains, and they reigned there in much
enmity, and they frequently laid waste that land,
and they fought two pitched battles, and many
times did each drive out the other. And the
same year that the army went forth over the
bridge at Paris, the Alderman Æthelhelm carried
to Rome the alms of the West Saxons and of
King Alfred.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p class="center">888.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Beocca carried the
alms of the West Saxons and of King Alfred to
Rome. And Queen Æthelswith, who was the
sister of King Alfred, died on her way to
Rome, and her body lieth at Pavia. And the
same year Æthered Archbishop of Canterbury,
and the Alderman Æthelwold died in one month.</p>


<p class="center">889.</p>

<p>This year no one journeyed to Rome, excepting
two couriers whom King Alfred sent with
letters.</p>


<p class="center">890.</p>

<p>This year the Abbot Beornhelm carried the
alms of King Alfred and the West Saxons to
Rome. And Godrun King of the Northmen
died; his baptismal name was Æthelstan, and he
was King Alfred’s godson: he dwelt in East
Anglia, and first colonized that land.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> And
the same year the army from the Seine went
to St. Lo, which is between Britanny and France,
and the Bretons fought with them, and gained
the victory, and drove them into a river and
drowned many. This year Plegemund was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>chosen of God and of all his saints to the Archbishoprick
of Canterbury.</p>


<p class="center">891.</p>

<p>This year the army went eastward, and King
Earnulf with the East French, and the Saxons,
and the Bavarians, fought with their horse before
the ships arrived, and put them to flight. And
three Scots came to King Alfred from Ireland,
in a boat without any rowers, and they had stolen
away from that country because they would go
on a pilgrimage for the love of God, they cared
not whither. The boat was made of three hides
and a half, and they took with them food for a
week, and in about seven days they came to land
in Cornwall, and proceeded forthwith to King
Alfred: they were thus named, Dubslane, and
Macbeth, and Maelinmun. And Swifneh the
most learned teacher of the Scots died. And
after Easter the same year, about Rogation week
or before, a star appeared which is called Cometa
in Latin, and some men say that this in English
signifies a hairy star, for long rays stream from
it, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the
other.</p>


<p class="center">893.</p>

<p>This year the great army, of which we have
before spoken, returned from the Eastern kingdom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>westward to Boulogne, and there they took
shipping; so that they came over at one passage,
horses and all. And they arrived at Limene
mutha (New Romney?) with 250 ships. This
harbour is on the eastern side of Kent, and
at the eastern end of the great wood called
Andred; this wood is from east to west 112 miles
long or more, and 30 miles broad, and the river
of which we have spoken floweth out of the
weald. They towed their ships up this river as
far as the wood, four miles from the outward
mouth. They stormed a fortress in the fens; a
few countrymen were in it, and it was half
finished. Soon afterwards, Hastings came into
the mouth of the Thames with 80 ships, and
there he built a fortress at Middel-tun (Milton),
and the other army one at Appledore.</p>

<p>“This year died Wulfhere Archbishop of the
Northumbrians.”</p>


<p class="center">894.</p>

<p>This year, it being about 12 months, after
they had built the fortress in the eastern
kingdom, the Northumbrians and the East Angles,
who had taken oaths to King Alfred, the
East Angles having also given him six hostages,
yet broke their faith, and whenever the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>armies went out to plunder, these went forth also,
either with them or in a separate division. Then
King Alfred gathered together his troops, and
came and encamped between the two armies in
the nearest place defended by wood and by water,
so that he could fall upon either, if they sought
any field for forage; whilst they still going
about the weald in parties of foot and troops
of horse, to plunder the country wherever it
was unprotected, continually encountered other
parties from the King’s army or from the towns
day and night. The King had also divided
his forces into two parts, so that half his troops
were always at home, and half out, exclusive of
those who were employed in guarding the towns.
Neither were all the heathen forces out of their
quarters at the same time oftener than twice, once
when they first came to land before the King’s
army was assembled, and again when they would
depart from this station. Then when they had collected
much plunder, and would have carried it
northward across the Thames into Essex, and towards
the ships, the King’s army hastened before
them, and fought with them at Farnham, and put
them to flight, and got possession of the spoil;
and they fled across the Thames, where there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>was no ford, and thence down the Colne to a
certain island (Mersey or Bricklesey). The King’s
troops<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a> remained encamped round about them as
long as they had provisions, for their time of service
was limited, and their meat proportioned
thereto. And the King being on his march thither
with the shire that served under him, the other
troops departed home, and the Danes remained in
the same place, because their King had been wounded
in the battle, and they could not remove him.
Then the Danes who were settled in Northumberland
and East Anglia gathered together
about an hundred ships, with which they sailed
round by the south; and some forty ships besides
which sailed round by the north, and besieged a
fortress on the northern coast of Devonshire.
And those who had sailed by the south besieged
Exeter. When the King heard this, he turned
westward with all his forces, excepting a detachment
of troops who were to watch the enemy in
the east. These troops went forward until they
came to London, and then, with the citizens and
the aids which joined them from the west, they
marched eastward to Benfleet: Hastings had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>come thither with his army, which was before
at Milton, and the great army was come thither
also which was before at Appledore, near Limine
Mutha. Hastings had built the fortress at Benfleet,
and he was then gone out to plunder,
and the great army was at home. Then they
came, and put that army to flight, and stormed
the fortress, and they took all that was therein,
treasure, women, and children, and they carried
all to London, and they broke up or burned
all the ships, or brought them to London or
Rochester. And the wife of Hastings and
his two sons were brought to the King, and
the King gave them to him again, because the
one was his own Godson, the other the Alderman
Æthered’s. They had been before taken, ere
Hastings came to Benfleet, and he had given hostages
and oaths, and the King had also given him
much money, and then also he had restored
his wife and children. But as soon as he came to
Benfleet, and the fortress was finished, he ravaged
the very district of Alfred’s kingdom which was
under his son’s Godfather Æthered, and again
a second time he was gone out to plunder the
same province, when his fortress was destroyed.
The King, as was said before, had marched with
his army towards Exeter, and when he came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>thither, the army which had besieged the town
made for the ships. Whilst he was engaged with
his enemies in the west, both the other ravaging
armies joined at Shobury, in Essex, and they raised
a fortress there: then they went up together along
the Thames, and a reinforcement came to them
from East Anglia and Northumberland, and they
proceeded by the side of the Thames, until they
crossed over to the Severn; and then they marched
along the Severn. Then the Aldermen Æthered,
and Æthelm, and Æthelnoth, and the
King’s Thanes who were at home in their fortresses,
gathered together an army from every
town east of the Parret, and west of Selwood,
also east and north of the Thames, and west of
the Severn, and they raised moreover some part
of the Welsh nation. When they were all assembled
they came up with the army at Butdiging-tun
(Bultington?) on the banks of the Severn,
and there they besieged them on every side in a
fortress. When they had been encamped on the
two sides of the river for many weeks, the King
being still detained by the fleet in the west, in
Devonshire, the Danes were pressed by hunger,
and they had eaten great part of their horses,
and some perished through famine. Then they
rushed out upon the men who were posted on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>the eastern side of the river, and fought with
them, and the Christians gained the victory, but
the King’s Thane Ordhelm was slain there, and
many others of the King’s Thanes; and those (of
the heathens) who escaped were saved by flight.
When they came to their fortress and ships in
Essex, the remnant again collected a large army
from amongst the East Angles and Northumbrians
before winter, and they secured their wives,
and their ships, and their treasures, in East
Anglia, and marched straight forward day and
night until they came to a western town in Wirehall
which is called Lega-ceaster (Chester).—And
the King’s troops could not overtake them
until they were within the fortifications; nevertheless
they encamped around the place for about
two days, and they took all the cattle that were
in the neighbourhood, and they slew the men
whom they met without the fortress, and they
burned the corn, or, together with their horses,
consumed it. And this was about twelve months
from the time that they came hither from beyond
sea.</p>


<p class="center">895.</p>

<p>This year, soon afterwards, the army went from
Wirehall into North Wales, for they could not
remain without corn or cattle to subsist on.—Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>they departed again from North Wales
with their plunder, and they passed through
Northumberland and East Anglia, and the King’s
army could not overtake them before they had
reached the eastern part of Essex, and had come
to an island in the sea which is called Mersey.—And
the division which had besieged Exeter, on
their return homewards invaded the South Saxons
near Chichester, but the townsmen put them to
flight, and slew many hundreds of them, and
took some of their ships. The same year, before
winter, the Danes who were quartered in Mersey
towed their ships up the Thames, and thence up
the Lea. This was about two years from the
time that they came hither from beyond the
sea.</p>


<p class="center">896.</p>

<p>This year the aforesaid army built a fortress
on the Lea, 20 miles above London. Then in
the summer, many of the citizens with others
went forth and attacked this fortress of the Danes,
but they were driven back, and some four of the
King’s Thanes were slain there. During the
following harvest, the King encamped in the
neighbourhood of the city while the people reaped
their corn, that the Danes might not annoy them.
One day the King was riding by the river’s side,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>and he observed a place where it might be
blocked up so that the Danes could not bring
out their ships: and this was done, and two forts
were built, one on each side of the river; but
while the King was employed on these works,
and was encamped by them, the Danes perceiving
that they could not remove their ships, deserted
them, and marched across the country until they
came to Cwat-bridge (Bridgenorth?), on the
Severn, and they built a fortress there. Then
the King’s troops rode westward after them, and
the citizens of London went for the ships and
broke up all that they could not remove, and all
that were serviceable they brought into London.
The Danes had placed their wives in safety in
East Anglia before they left their fortress. They
remained at Cwat-bridge that winter. This was
about three years from the time when they came
over the sea into Limine-Mutha.</p>


<p class="center">897.</p>

<p>It was in the summer of this year that the army
went away, part to East Anglia and part to Northumberland:
and there, those who were without
money, got themselves ships, and sailed southward
to the Seine. Thanks to God, this army
had not entirely ruined the English nation, but
in these three years it was much afflicted by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>mortality amongst the cattle, and more than all
by that amongst men, and many of the most
noble of the King’s Thanes died during these
three years. Among these were Swithulf Bishop
of Rochester, Ceolmund Alderman of Kent,
Beorhtulf Alderman of Essex, Wulfred Alderman
of Hampshire, Ealheard Bishop of Dorchester,
Eadulf the King’s Thane in Sussex, Beornwulf
the Town Sheriff of Winchester, Ecgulf
the King’s Horse Thane and many others, though
I have named these as being the most eminent.
The same year the ravagers from East Anglia
and Northumberland harassed the country of the
West Saxons, particularly on the southern coast,
by sudden descents, using the vessels which they
had built many years before. Then Alfred caused
long ships to be built as a defence against these
vessels, and his were twice as long as the others;
some had sixty oars and some more; they were
both swifter and more steady, and also higher
than those of the Danes, and were shaped neither
after the Frisian nor the Danish manner, but
even as he himself thought they would best befit
the service. At one time this year six ships came
to Wight, and did much damage there, and in
Devon, and all along the coast. The King ordered
his people to take nine of the new ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>and to blockade them in a certain harbour.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a>—Then
the pirates sailed out against them with
three ships, for three lay aground at the head of
the bay, and their crews were gone ashore.—The
King’s men took two of the three ships at
the entrance of the bay, and slew the men in
them, and the third escaped, and in this also all
but five of the men were killed. But in making
towards the other ships, which were set fast, the
English also were left aground to their great discomfort,
three on that part of the shore where
the Danish ships lay, and all the rest on the other
side, so that they could not get near each other,
and the water had now ebbed many furlongs from
the ships. Then the Danes belonging to the
three ships came and attacked the three which
were left by the tide on their side of the bay,
and they fought there, and Lucumon the King’s
Sheriff, and Wulfheard and Æbba and Æthelere,
Frisians, and Æthelferth the King’s herdsman,
were slain, and sixty two men in all, Frisians
and English, and 120 Danes. Now the tide
came to the Danish ships before the Christians
could get theirs off, and they therefore rowed
them away; but they were so much damaged, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>they were unable to get beyond Sussex before
two of them had been driven on shore, and the
men were brought to the King at Winchester and
he ordered them to be hanged. The rest much
wounded, with the remaining ship, reached East
Anglia. This year, not less than twenty ships
with their whole crews, perished on the southern
coast. The same year died the King’s Horse
Thane Wulfric, who was also Sheriff of Wales.</p>


<p class="center">898.</p>

<p>This year Æthhelm Alderman of Wiltshire
died nine nights before Midsummer. And Heahstan
Bishop of London died this year.</p>


<p class="center">901.</p>

<p>This year Alfred the son of Athulf died six
nights before the feast of All Saints: He was
King over all England, excepting that part of it
which was under the dominion of the Danes.—He
reigned 28 years and a half, and his son Edward
succeeded to the kingdom. Then Edward’s
uncle’s son Prince Æthelwald rode to the towns
of Winborn and Tweonea (Christ Church) without
leave of the King and his Witan, upon
which the King went forth with his troops and
encamped at Badbury, near Winborn, and
Æthelwald with his party was within the town.
He had blocked up the gates on the inside, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>said that there he would live or die, but yet he
stole away by night, and hastened towards the
army in Northumberland; the King ordered his
troops to pursue him, but they could not outride
him, and the others received him as their king,
and submitted to him: his wife was seized; he
had married her without the King’s leave, and
against the Bishop’s command, for she had been
professed a nun. Æthered Alderman of Devonshire
died the same year, four weeks before King
Alfred.</p>


<p class="center">902.</p>

<p>In this year the battle of Holme (near Pevensey)
was fought between the men of Kent and
the Danes.</p>


<p class="center">903.</p>

<p>This year died the Alderman Athulf the brother
of Ealhswitha the mother of King Edward.
Virgilius Abbot of the Scots died also; and on
the 8th of the ides of July the Priest Grimbald.
The same year the new monastery of Winchester
was consecrated on the Advent of St. Judoc.</p>


<p class="center">904.</p>

<p>This year Æthelwald came hither from beyond
the sea with all the ships he could muster, and
the East Saxons submitted to him. This year
the moon was eclipsed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p class="center">905.</p>

<p>This year Æthelwald induced the army in
East Anglia to break the peace, and they ravaged
Mercia as far as Crecca-gelade (Cricklade), and
they crossed the Thames there, and took all they
could meet with in Brædune (Breden forest,
Wiltshire), and in the neighbourhood, and then
they returned homeward. Then King Edward
pursued after them as soon as he could assemble
his army, and he laid waste their land between
the Dyke (the Devil’s Ditch) and the Ouse, as
far northward as the fens. And when he was
about to depart thence, he caused it to be proclaimed
throughout his army, that all the troops
should keep together, but the Kentish men remained
behind against his command, though he
had sent them seven messages. Then the Danes
surrounded them, and they fought, and the Aldermen
Siwulf and Sigelm, and the King’s
Thane Eadwold, and the Abbot Cenwulf, and
Sigebryht the son of Siwulf, and Eadwald the
son of Acca, were slain there, and many others;
though I have named the most noted. And there
fell on the side of the Danes, their King Eohric,
and Prince Æthelwald who had persuaded them
to the war, and Byrhtsige the son of Prince
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>Beornoth, and the Holds<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a> Ysopa and Oscytel,
and a great many others whom we cannot now
name. There was much slaughter on either side,
but most on that of the Danes, though they kept
possession of the field of battle. Ealhswyth died
the same year, and a comet appeared.</p>


<p class="center">907.</p>

<p>This year Alfred who was Sheriff of Bath died:
and the same year peace was ratified at Yttingaford<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a>
with the East Angles and Northumbrians,
on the terms which King Edward dictated. This
year Lig-ceaster (Chester) was repaired.</p>


<p class="center">909.</p>

<p>This year Denulf Bishop of Winchester died,
and the body of St. Oswald was brought from
Bardney into Mercia.</p>


<p class="center">910.</p>

<p>This year Frithestan received the Bishoprick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>of Winchester, and after this Asser Bishop of
Sherborn died. And the same year King Edward
sent forth an army of West Saxons and
Mercians, who greatly harassed the army in the
north, and seized many prisoners, and took much
plunder of all kinds, and slew many Danes, and
they remained five weeks in those parts.</p>


<p class="center">911.</p>

<p>This year the army in Northumberland broke
the peace, and set at nought all the conditions
which King Edward and his son had prescribed;
and they ravaged Mercia. And the King had
assembled about an hundred ships, and he was
in Kent, and the ships sailed to the south-east
along the coast to join him. The heathens believed
that the greater part of his forces was in
these ships, and that they might therefore go
where they would unmolested. When the King
heard that they were gone out to plunder, he
sent his West Saxon and Mercian troops, and
they followed the Danes, and came up with them
as they returned homeward, and they attacked
them and put them to flight, and killed many
thousands. And King Eowils and King Healfden
were slain, and the Earl Ohter, and the Earl
Scurfa, and the Hold Othulf, and the Hold Benesing,
and Anlaf the black, and the Hold Thurferth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>and Osferth the collector of tribute, and
the Hold Guthferth, and the Hold Agmund, and
Guthferth.</p>


<p class="center">912.</p>

<p>This year Æthered Alderman of Mercia died,
and King Edward took into his own government
the towns of London and Oxford, and all the
lands belonging thereto; and this year on the
holy eve of the discovery of the sacred cross,
Æthelflæd the Lady of Mercia came to Scergeate
and built a fortified town there, and in the
same year that of Bricge (Bridgenorth).</p>


<p class="center">913.</p>

<p>This year, about Martinmas, King Edward
caused the northern town of Hertford to be built,
between the Mermera, the Benefica (the Bean),
and the Lea. And afterwards, between Rogation
week and Midsummer, King Edward went with
some of his forces to Malden, and remained there
while they built and fortified the town of Witham.
And a great part of this country, which
had been under the Danish Government, submitted
to him. During this time some of his
forces built that part of the town of Hertford
which is on the south side of the Lea. This
year, God permitting, Æthelflæd the Lady of
Mercia, went with all the Mercians to Tamworth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>and built a fenced town there in the
early part of the summer, and before Lammas she
built the town of Stafford. And the next year
she built Eadesbyrig<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a> in the beginning of the
summer, and Warwick towards the end of
autumn, and after Christmas the year following
she built the fortified town of Cyric-byrig,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a> and
afterwards that of Weard-byrig,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a> and again before
Christmas that year, that of Rumcofan,
(Runkhorn, Cheshire).</p>


<p class="center">916.</p>

<p>This year the guiltless Abbot Ecgbriht was slain
before Midsummer, on the 16th of the calends of
July, the anniversary of the martyrdom of St. Cyricius
and his companions. And about three days
afterwards Æthelflæd sent an army into Wales,
and took Brecenanmere (Brecknock) and the
King’s wife, with some four and thirty others,
were made prisoners.</p>


<p class="center">917.</p>

<p>This year, after Easter, the army rode forth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>from Northampton and Leicester, and they broke
the peace and slew many men at Hocneratun
(Hognorton) and in the neighbourhood. And as
soon as these returned home, another troop was
immediately assembled, which rode forth towards
Ligtun (Leighton, Bedfordshire), but the inhabitants
of that country knew of their coming, and
fought with them, and completely routed them,
and seized all the plunder which they had amassed,
and a great part of their horses and arms.</p>


<p class="center">918.</p>

<p>This year a pirate fleet came over from the
south from the land of the Lidwiccas (Britanny),
with two Earls Ohtor and Hroald, and they
sailed westward and entered the Severn’s mouth,
and they plundered the coasts of North Wales
wherever they could; and they took Bishop
Cameleac, at Ircinga-feld (Archenfield), and led
him away to their ships, and King Edward afterwards
ransomed him for forty pounds. Then
afterwards all the army landed, and would have
marched yet again towards Archenfield to plunder,
but then the men of Hereford and of Gloucester,
and of the nearest towns met them, and
fought with them, and put them to flight; and
they slew the Earl Hroald, and a brother of the
other Earl Ohtor, and they drove the rest into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>a wood and besieged them there until they gave
hostages that they would depart from the dominions
of King Edward. The King had taken
care to post troops so as to guard the southern
coast of the channel from Wales in the west
(Cornwall), to the mouth of the Avon eastward,
that they might not dare to invade the country on
that side. Nevertheless they landed by night at
two several times, once east of Weced (Watchet),
and again at Portloca (Porlock). And the
King’s men repulsed them each time, and few
escaped but those alone, who swam to the ships;
and these remained in the isle of Bradanrelic
(Steepholm?) until they were in great want of
of provisions, and many died of hunger because
they could not procure any food; then they went
to Deomod (South Wales), and thence away to
Ireland. And afterwards, the same year, King
Edward went to Buckingham with his army, and
he remained there four weeks, and built fortifications
on each side of the river before he departed
thence. And Earl Thurcytel acknowledged
him as his Lord, as did all the Holds and
chief men of Bedford, and most of those of
Northampton. Before Lammas, this year, Æthelflæd
the Lady of Mercia, by the help of God
won the town of Derby, with all its appurtenances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>but four of her most valued Thanes were
slain within the gates.</p>


<p class="center">919.</p>

<p>This year, before Martinmas, King Edward
went with an army to Bedford, and he gained
possession of that town, and almost all the inhabitants
who had before been subject to him
returned to their obedience; and he remained
there four weeks, and he caused the fortifications
on the south side of the river to be built
before he departed thence.</p>


<p class="center">920.</p>

<p>This year King Edward went to Malden, and
repaired and fortified the town before he departed
thence. And this year Earl Thurcytel and his
adherents went over sea into France, with the
permission and aid of King Edward. Early in
this year Æthelflæd got possession of Leicester
without fighting, and the greater part of the
troops of that town became subject to her.
Those at York had also engaged to be under
her command, some having given pledges
to her, and others having taken oaths. And
immediately after she had effected this, she
died at Tamworth, twelve days before Midsummer,
in the eighth year of her governing Mercia
with rightful dominion; and her body lieth at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>Gloucester, in the eastern aisle of St. Peter’s
Church. This year also the daughter of Æthered
Lord of Mercia was wholly deprived of the
government of Mercia, and carried into Wessex,
three weeks before Christmas; her name was
Hælfwin.</p>


<p class="center">921.</p>

<p>This year, before Easter, King Edward ordered
his people to go to Tofeceaster (Towcester),
and to build a fortress there. And again
this year, in Rogation week, he caused a fortress
to be built at Wigingamere (Wigmore). And
between Lammas and Midsummer, the troops
of Northampton, and of Leicester, and of the
country north of these places, broke the peace,
and marched to Towcester, and fought all
day against the town, and they thought that
they should have taken it by storm, but the
men who were within defended it until more
aid arrived; and then these gave up the attack
and departed. Again, very soon afterwards,
they went forth by night on a secret expedition,
and came unawares, and seized many
prisoners and much cattle between Burnewuda
(Bernwood forest) and Ægles-byrig (Ailesbury).
And at the same time the army of Huntingdon
and of East Anglia came, and built the fortress
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>at Temesford (Tempsford), where they fixed
themselves, and strengthened the place, deserting
their other post of Huntingdon; and they intended
to make their excursions from this station,
and thought that thus they should again get the
greater part of this land into their power. And
they went forth until they came to Bedford, but
the garrison marched out against them, and fought
with them, and put them to flight, and slew a
great part of them. Yet after this a great army
again assembled from East Anglia and Mercia
and proceeded to Wigmore, and they surrounded
the place, and fought against it till
late in the day, and they seized the cattle in
the neighbourhood; nevertheless the garrison defended
the town and they gave up the assault and
departed. After this, the same summer, a large
body of King Edward’s subjects was collected
from the towns<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a> nearest Tempsford, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>marched thither and besieged that town, and they
fought against it until they took it. And they
slew the King and Earl Toglos, and his son Earl
Manna, and his brother and all those who would
have resisted, and they took captive the remainder,
and the town they plundered. And immediately
after this, in harvest, a great force was
collected out of Kent, out of Surrey, and out of
Essex, and out of the towns around on all sides,
and they marched to Colchester, and they besieged
the town and fought against it until they
subdued it, and they seized all that was therein,
and they slew all the inhabitants excepting those
who escaped over the wall. And during the same
autumn a great army was gathered together out of
East Anglia, consisting of the land forces, and also
of such Vikingar as the others had persuaded
to join them; and they thought to satisfy their
desire of vengeance. They went to Malden and
besieged that town, and they fought there until
aid came to the Burghers from without, and
then the army left the town and departed. And
the townsmen, and those who had arrived to succour
them, sallied forth after them, and put
them to flight, and slew many hundreds both
pirates and others. Immediately after this, during
the same autumn, King Edward went to Passenham
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>with the troops of Wessex, and he abode
there while his men inclosed Towcester with a
stone wall. And Earl Thurferth and the Holds,
and all the army at Northampton, and those, of
the country northward as far as Weolud (the
Welland), came over to him, and acknowledged
him as their Lord and protector. And when at
the regular time the troops he had with him returned
to their homes, others took the field, and
these proceeded to Huntingdon, and they repaired
the town by King Edward’s orders, and rebuilt
that part of it which had been pulled down.
And all who remained of the inhabitants of that
country gave themselves up to King Edward,
and sought his favour and protection. And
again the same year, before Martinmas, King
Edward went to Colchester with the Wessex
troops, and he repaired the town and restored
that which had been demolished. And a large
body of people in East Anglia and in Essex,
who had before been under the Danish dominion,
came over to him. And all the army of East
Anglia swore to be as one with him; that they
would will all that he should will, and that they
would keep peace both by sea and land with all
whom he should befriend. And the army at
Grantanbrycge (Cambridge) separately acknowledged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>him for their Lord and patron, and confirmed
this with oaths even as he had desired.
This year King Sihtric slew his brother Niel.</p>


<p class="center">922.</p>

<p>This year, between Rogation week and Midsummer,
King Edward went with an army to
Stamford, and caused fortifications to be made on
the southern side of the river, and the inhabitants
of the town on the northern bank submitted
to him, and acknowledged him as their Lord.—And
whilst he remained at this place, his sister
Æthelflæd died at Tamworth, twelve days before
Midsummer. And then he rode to the town of
Tamworth, and all the people, who had been
under the government of Æthelflæd became his
subjects: and the Kings of North Wales, Howel
and Cledauc and Jeothwel, and all that nation,
acknowledged him as their Lord. Thence he
went to Nottingham, and he took that town, and
caused it to be repaired, and he peopled it with
English and Danes. And all the inhabitants of
Mercia, both Danes and English, came over to him.</p>


<p class="center">923.</p>

<p>This year, after harvest, King Edward went
with an army to Thælwæl (Thelwall), and
caused that town to be built and fortified and
garrisoned. And whilst he abode there, he commanded
another army, raised in Mercia, to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>to Manchester, in Northumberland, to repair
and garrison that town. This year Archbishop
Plegemund died; and King Regnold conquered
York.</p>


<p class="center">924.</p>

<p>This year, before Midsummer, King Edward
went with an army to Nottingham, and caused a
town to be built on the south side of the river,
over against the other, with a bridge across the
Trent between the two. And thence he went
to Badecanwylla (Bakewell), in Peakland, and
caused a town to be built and garrisoned in
the neighbourhood. And the King of the Scots
and all the Scottish nation chose him for their
Father and Lord, and thus did Regwnald and
the sons of Eadulf, and all the inhabitants of
Northumberland, both English and Danes,
Northmen and others; also the King of the
Strathclyde Britons and all that people.</p>


<p class="center">925.</p>

<p>This year King Edward died at Fearndun (Ferringdon),
in Mercia, and very soon afterwards
his son Ælfweard died at Oxford, and their bodies
rest in Winchester. And Æthestan was chosen
King by the Mercians, and he was consecrated at
Cingestun (Kingston upon Thames). And St.
Duntstan was born, and Wulfhelm received the
Archbishoprick of Canterbury.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p class="center">927.</p>

<p>This year King Æthelstan expelled King Guthfrith,
and this year Archbishop Wulfhelm went
to Rome.</p>


<p class="center">928.</p>

<p>William succeeded in Normandy, and held
the government 15 years.</p>


<p class="center">932.</p>

<p>This year Byrnstan was consecrated Bishop of
Winchester, on the 4th of the calends of June,
and he held the Bishoprick two years and a
half.</p>


<p class="center">933.</p>

<p>This year Bishop Frithestan died; and Prince
Ædwine was drowned in the sea.</p>


<p class="center">934.</p>

<p>This year King Athelstan invaded Scotland
with an army and a fleet, and he ravaged a great
part of the country. And Bishop Byrnstan died
at Winchester on All Saint’s day.</p>


<p class="center">935.</p>

<p>This year Bishop Ælfheah received the Bishoprick
of Winchester.</p>


<p class="center">938.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a></p>

<p>This year King Athelstan the Lord of Earls,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>the Giver of Bracelets to the Nobles, and his
brother Edmund the Atheling, the elder, the survivors
of their race, the children of Edward,
won lasting glory with the edge of the sword in
battle at Brunanburh.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> They clave the wooden
walls, they hewed down the tall banners, for it
was the portion of their lineage, that oft in the
field they should defend their lands, their treasures,
their homes, against the enemy. The Scot
and the Ship-man fell on every side—the din of
arms resounded sith the sun in the morning tide
rose glad over the earth, greatest of the stars, bright
candle of God the Lord Eternal, till the noblest
of things created sank in the west. There, struck
down with darts, lay many a warrior, Northmen
pierced over their shields—Scots the savages of
war—The West Saxons, a chosen band, pressed
the live-long day upon the hated people. Sternly
they smote down the flying multitudes, with
swords well sharpened at the stone. The Mercians
shrank not from the hard play of hands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>Safety there was none for the companions of
Anlaf, for those who sought the land for deadly
fight over the billowy sea, bosomed in ships.—Five
young Kings lay on the battle field, put to
sleep by the swords. So also seven Earls of
Anlaf, and of the host from the fleet, and of the
Scots, more than can be numbered. The King
of the Northmen with his little troop fled in his
terror to the voice of the ship; the King of the
Fleet, with one ship’s crew, living escaped over
the yellow deep.</p>

<p>So also the routed Constantine returned a fugitive
to his northern hills. The hoary warrior
needed not to exult in the conflict of swords.—He
was the remnant of his race. His kinsmen
were heaped on the field—slain in the battle.
He left his son on the place of blood, covered
with wounds. Young in war though old in wisdom,
the fair-haired youth was staid in his glorying
by the bill of slaughter.</p>

<p>Neither could Anlaf and his broken army boast
that they were better in works of battle; at the
fall of banners, at the meeting of darts, in the
conflict of men, in the exchange of weapons,
when they had played with the children of Edward
in the field of death.</p>

<p>The Northmen, the sorrowful few spared by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>the darts, departed in their nailed ships over the
roaring sea—over the deep waters. They sailed
for Dublin, and disgraced their land.</p>

<p>Then the brothers, the King and the Atheling,
returned to their country, the West Saxon land.
They left behind them the screamers of war, the
birds of prey. The sallow kite, and the black
raven with the horny beak, and the hoarse-voiced
eagle devouring the white flesh, with the
battle-hawk, and the grey beast the wolf of the
wood. Never in this island had a greater destruction
of men been worked by the edge of the
sword, say the books of the Wise Elders, since
the Saxons and the Angles came hither from the
east—to Britain over the broad sea. Since those
glorious Earls, who smote the Welch on the anvil
of battle, and obtained their lands.</p>


<p class="center">941.</p>

<p>This year King Athelstan died on the 6th of
the calends of November, forty-one years all but
one day after the death of King Alfred; and the
Prince Edmund succeeded to the kingdom. He
was then 18 years old; and King Athelstan had
reigned 14 years and 10 weeks.</p>


<p class="center">942.</p>

<p>This year King Edmund, the Lord of the English,
the protector of his kinsmen, the worker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>of mighty deeds, conquered all Mercia unto the
way of the white spring, and the broad and sea-like
stream of the river Humber. Five towns,
Leicester, and Lincoln, and Nottingham, Stamford
also, and Derby, lay in Danish thraldom,
bowed under the power of the Northmen, held
in long durance, until the warlike heir of Edward,
to his own glory, delivered them from
heathen bondage.</p>

<p>King Edmund stood as godfather at the baptism
of King Anlaf; and late in the same year he
was godfather to King Regenold at his confirmation.
This year King Anlaf died. And Richard
the Elder succeeded (in Normandy), and reigned
52 years.</p>


<p class="center">944.</p>

<p>This year King Edmund reduced all Northumberland,
and drove out two Kings, Anlaf the
son of Syhtric and Regenald the son of Guthferth.</p>


<p class="center">945.</p>

<p>This year King Edmund ravaged all Cumberland,
and gave it to Malcolm King of the Scots,
on condition that he should join forces with him
by sea and by land.</p>


<p class="center">946.</p>

<p>This year King Edmund died<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a> on St. Augustine’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>day; he had reigned six years and an half,
and his brother Prince Edred succeeded to the
kingdom. He soon brought all Northumberland
into his power, and the Scots took oaths that
they would will all that he should will.</p>

<p class="center">949.</p>

<p>This year Anlaf came back to Northumberland.</p>


<p class="center">951.</p>

<p>This year Ælfheah Bishop of Winchester
died on St. Gregory’s day.</p>


<p class="center">952.</p>

<p>This year the Northumbrians drove out King
Anlaf, and took for their king Yric the son of
Harold.</p>


<p class="center">954.</p>

<p>This year the Northumbrians expelled Yric,
and King Ædred took to himself the kingdom of
Northumberland.</p>


<p class="center">955.</p>

<p>This year King Ædred died in the prime of
life on St. Clement’s day; he had reigned nine
years and a half: then Edwy the son of King
Edmund and of St. Ælgiva, succeeded to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>kingdom, and he banished St. Dunstan from the
country.</p>


<p class="center">956.</p>

<p>This year Wulstan Archbishop of York died;
and this year Prince Edgar received the kingdom
of Mercia.</p>


<p class="center">957.</p>

<p>This year King Edwy died on the calends of
October, and his brother Edgar took to himself
the kingdom of Wessex, as well as Mercia and
Northumberland; he was then 16 years old.—There
was prosperity in his days, and God gave
him to abide in peace so long as he lived, and
he, as it beseemed him, strove to merit this
favour. He every where exalted the glory of
God, and he loved the laws of God, and attended
to the peace of the people, more than any
King before in the memory of man. And God
also shewed him favour, so that Kings and Earls
willingly obeyed him, and submitted to that
which he desired, and without opposition he
ruled all things according to his own pleasure.
He was greatly honoured throughout the nation
because he willingly gave honour to the name of
God, and he often meditated in the law of God,
and exalted the glory of God far and wide, and
he always took wise counsel for his people before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>God and before the world. Yet was he guilty
of one great sin, in that he loved the vicious
habits of foreign nations, and established heathenish
customs in this land, and invited hither
outlandish and mischievous people: but God
grant that his good actions may have outweighed
his misdeeds, to the salvation of his soul in the
last day. This year he sent for St. Dunstan and
gave him the bishoprick of Worcester, and afterwards
that of London.</p>


<p class="center">961.</p>

<p>This year the good Archbishop Odo died, and
St. Dunstan<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> received the Archbishoprick of
Canterbury. This year the King’s kinsman
Ælfgar died in Devon, and his body lieth at
Wilton. And King Sigeferth killed himself, and
his body resteth at Winborn. And this year
there was a great pestilence among men, and a
great fever in London, and Paul’s monastery was
burned and was rebuilt the same year. This
year the priest Athelmod went to Rome, and he
died there on the 18th of the calends of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>
<p class="center">963.</p>

<p>This year the Deacon Wulfstan died, on
Childermas-day, and after this died Cyric the
Priest. The same year the Abbot Athelwold received
the Bishoprick of Winchester, and was
consecrated on a Sunday, the vigil of St. Andrew.
The second year after his consecration
be founded many monasteries, and he drove the
clergy out of his bishoprick because they would
observe no rule, and he placed monks in their
room. He founded two abbeys, one for monks,
the other for nuns, both in Winchester. Afterwards
he went to King Edgar, and desired of
him that he would give him all the monasteries
which the heathens had destroyed, for that he
would restore them; and the King willingly
granted his request. And the Bishop came first
to Ely, where. St. Ætheldrith lieth, and he
caused the monastery to be rebuilt, and he gave
it to one of his monks named Brihtnoth. He
consecrated him abbot, and he established monks
there to serve God, whereas the place was formerly
inhabited by nuns, and he bought many
small estates of the King, and made it very rich.
Afterwards Bishop Athelwold came to the monastery
that is called Medeshamstede, which had
been destroyed by the heathens, and he found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>nothing there but old walls and wild woods. He
found also hidden in the old wall the records
which the abbot Headda had formerly written,
how King Wulfhere and his brother Æthelred
had built the monastery, and had made it free of
the King, of the Bishop, and of all earthly service;
and how the Pope Agatho had confirmed
this with his rescript, and the Archbishop Deusdedit
also. He then caused the monastery to be
rebuilt, and he appointed an abbot whose name
was Aldulf, and he peopled that place with
monks, which was before a wilderness. Then
he came to the King, and caused him to look at
the writings which had been found, and the King
then answered and said, “I King Edgar, before
God and in presence of the Archbishop Dunstan,
do this day grant to St. Peter’s monastery of Medeshamstede,
freedom from subjection to the
King and to the Bishop, and do endow it with
all these adjoining villages, to wit, Æst-feld
(Eastfield), and Dodes-thorp (Dasthorp), and
Ege (Eye), and Pastun (Paston). And I so
make it free, that no Bishop shall have any authority
over it, but the abbot of the monastery
alone. And I give the town called Undela
(Oundle) with all the land belonging to it, which
is called the Eahte hundred, with the markets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>and tolls, so freely, that neither the King, nor the
Bishop, nor the Earl, nor the Sheriff of the
county, shall have any power there, neither any
man, excepting the abbot alone, and those whom
he may appoint thereto. And at the request of
Bishop Athelwold, I give these lands to Christ
and to St. Peter, to wit, Barwe (Barrow or Berk,
Rutland), Wermington (Warmington, Northamptonshire),
Æsctun (Ashton, near Oundle?),
Kettering, Castra (Castor, Northamptonshire),
Egleswurthe (Ailesworth), Walton, Withringtun
(Werrington), Ege (Eye), Thorp (near Kettering);
and I empower them to have a moneyer
at Stamford. And I herewith assign to Christ
and to St. Peter the sac and soc, toll and team,
and infangentheof, and all other rights attached
to the lands, and to others belonging to the
monastery. And I give two parts of Witlesmere
(Whittleseymere) with the waters, the wears, and
the fens, and so on through Merelade unto the
river which is called the Nen, and so eastward
to Cyngesdælf. And it is my will that a
market be held in that town, and that there be
no other betwixt Stamford and Huntingdon; and
I will, that the toll should be given thus: first,
from Witlesmere as far as the King’s toll of
Northmannes-cross (Normancross) hundred and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>again on the other side, from Witlesmere through
Merelade unto the Nen, and thence as the water
runneth to Croyland, and from Croyland to Must,
and from Must to Cyngesdælf and to Witlesmere.
And I will that all the exemptions and all the
privileges granted by my predecessors stand good
and I subscribe to this, and do confirm it with
the cross of Christ.” Then Dunstan the Archbishop
of Canterbury answered and said, “I confirm
all that has been said, and I will that all
things which thy predecessors and mine have,
granted should stand; and whosoever breaketh
this grant, to him give I the curse of God, and of
all the saints, and that of every consecrated head,
and my curse also, unless he come to repentance
I also give to St. Peter my surplice, stole, and
vestment for the service of Christ.” “I Oswald
Archbishop of York do ratify all these words
with the sign of the holy cross on which Christ
suffered.” “I Bishop Athelwold bless all who;
do observe this, and I excommunicate whomsoever
breaketh it, unless he come to repentance.”
There were present also the Bishops Ælfstan and
Athulf, and the Abbots Escwi and Osgar and
Æthelgar, and the Aldermen Ælfere, Æthelwine,
Brihtnoth, and Oslac, with many other
great men, and they all confirmed this grant, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>subscribed thereto the cross of Christ. This was
done 972 years after the birth of our Lord, and in
the 16th year of the King’s reign. Then the
Abbot Aldulf bought many lands, with which he
endowed the monastery; and he remained there till
the death of Oswald Archbishop of York, on which
he was chosen to succeed him. And another Abbot
was immediately chosen out of the same monastery;
his name was Kenulf, and he was afterwards
Bishop of Winchester. He first built the walls
round about the monastery, and he gave it the name
of Burch, whereas it had before been called Medeshamstede.
He remained there until he was nominated
Bishop of Winchester, and then another
Abbot, whose name was Ælfsi, was chosen out of
the same monastery. This Ælfsi was Abbot
there fifty years; he took up St. Kyneburh and
St. Kynesvith who lay at Castra (Castor), and
St. Tibba, who was buried at Rihala (Ryal or
Ryehall, Rutland), and he presented all these
relics to St. Peter in one day, and he kept them
whilst he remained there.</p>


<p class="center">964.</p>

<p>This year King Edgar drove the priests of
Winchester out of the old monastery, and out of
the new also, and out of Ceortesige (Chertsey),
and out of Middel-tun (Milton Abbey, Dorsetshire),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>and placed monks in their room. And he
made Æthelgar Abbot of the new monastery,
and Ordbryht Abbot of Chertsey, and Cyneweard
of Milton.</p>


<p class="center">966.</p>

<p>This year Thored the son of Gunner ravaged
Westmoreland: and the same year Oslac received
the office of Alderman.</p>


<p class="center">969.</p>

<p>This year King Edgar caused all Thanet to be
laid waste.</p>


<p class="center">970.</p>

<p>This year died Archbishop Oskytel. He was
first consecrated to the Bishoprick of Dorchester,
and was afterwards translated to the see of York,
with the sanction of King Edred and all his
Witan. He was Bishop 22 years, and he died
at Tame on All Saints’ night, ten nights before
Martinmas; and his kinsman the Abbot Thurkytel
carried the Bishop’s body to Bedford, for
he was Abbot there at that time.</p>


<p class="center">971.</p>

<p>This year Prince Edmund died, and he was
buried at Rumsige (Rumsey).</p>


<p class="center">973.</p>

<p>This year Edgar the ruler of the English was
consecrated as King with great pomp in the ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>town of Acemannes-ceaster, which the
inhabitants also call Bath. There was much
joy among all the sons of men on that blessed
day, called the day of Pentecost. There was
a multitude of priests, and a great throng of
monks, wise men in my mind, gathered together.
At that time ten hundred years were reckoned to
have passed away since the birth of the King of
glory, the Keeper of Light, excepting only,
that, as writers say, twenty-seven winters were
wanting thereto. So nearly was the thousandth
year of our conquering Lord completed when
this event took place. And the son of Edmund,
the man of mighty deeds, had then been nine
and twenty years in the world, and in his thirtieth
year he was a King, and consecrated.</p>

<p>And soon afterwards the King led all his fleet
to Chester; and six Kings met him there, and
promised faithfully that they would aid him by
sea and by land.</p>


<p class="center">975.</p>

<p>This year Edgar, King of the English, ended
his earthly joys; he chose for himself another
light, beautiful and pleasant, and gave up this
worthless life, which the children of the people,
the men of dust, confess to be so vain. It was in
that month which every where in this country
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>is called July by those who have been rightly
instructed in the art of numbers, and on the 18th
day of the month, that the young Edgar, the
giver of bracelets to the valiant, departed this
life. And then his son, a child not full-grown,
succeeded to the kingdom: he was the ruler of
Earls, and his name was Edward—a prince most
excellent. Ten days before this Britain lost
Cyneweard, that good and kindly Bishop. At
that time, to my mind, the glory of the Supreme
governor was trampled on throughout Mercia,
many of God’s wise servants were driven away,
and this was a great sorrow to those who bore in
their hearts and minds an ardent love of their
Creator. Then indeed was the author of miracles
set at nought, he who is the disposer of victory,
and the law-giver of heaven, when men violated
his right. And then also that beloved chieftain
Oslac was driven from the land, and that long-haired
warrior, wise and discreet in words, was
borne, bereaved of an home, on the rolling
waves, on the sea bird’s bath, on the roaring
waters, over the country of the whales. And
then a star appeared in the sky, above in the
firmament, which strong-minded men, of deep
learning, skilful men, and wise soothsayers,
universally call a comet. The vengeance of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>Almighty was upon the nation, and a dire famine
in the country. But this again, the ruler of
Heaven, the Lord of the angels, removed, and
gave bliss to every inhabitant through the fruitfulness
of the earth.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Ælfere caused the
monks to be turned out of very many monasteries
which the holy Bishop Athelwold had established
by the command of King Edgar. This
year the great Earl Oslac was driven from England.</p>


<p class="center">976.</p>

<p>This year there was a great famine in England.</p>


<p class="center">977.</p>

<p>This year a great meeting was held after Easter
at Kyntlingtun (Kirtlington?), and there Bishop
Sideman died suddenly on the 2d of the calends
of May. He was Bishop of Devonshire, and
he willed that his body’s resting place should be
at his metropolitan see of Cridiantun (Crediton).
Then King Edward and Archbishop Dunstan
commanded that he should be carried to St.
Mary’s monastery of Abbandun (Abingdon);
this was done, and he was honourably buried in
the north side of St. Peter’s aisle.</p>


<p class="center">978.</p>

<p>This year all the chief of the Witan of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>English nation fell from an upper floor at Calne,
excepting the holy Archbishop Dunstan alone,
who stood upon a beam, and some had their
bones broken, and others escaped not with their
lives. This year King Edward was slain at
Corfes-geat (Corfe Castle), in the evening of the
15th of the calends of April, and he was buried
at Wareham without any royal honours. No
worse deed than this had been committed amongst
the people of the Angles since they first came to
the land of Britain. Men murdered him, but
God gave him glory. In his life he was an
earthly King, but now after his death he is a
Saint in heaven. His mortal kinsmen would not
avenge him, but his heavenly Father hath avenged
him greatly. His earthly murderers would have
blotted out his memory from the world, but the
avenger who is above hath widely extended his
fame in heaven and earth: and whereas they
formerly would not bow down before his living
body, now they piteously bend their knees to his
dead bones. We may gather hence, that the
wisdom of men, their devices and counsels, avail
nothing against the purposes of God. And the
same year his brother Prince Æthelred took to
himself the kingdom, and was consecrated very
soon afterwards at Cyninges-tun (Kingston), with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>great rejoicing of the Witan of the English
nation.</p>


<p class="center">980.</p>

<p>This year St. Dunstan and the Alderman
Ælfhere fetched the body of the holy King St.
Edward from Wareham, and brought it with
great pomp to Shaftesbury.</p>


<p class="center">981.</p>

<p>This year seven ships first came and plundered
Southampton.</p>


<p class="center">983.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Ælfhere died and
Ælfric succeeded to his office.</p>


<p class="center">984.</p>

<p>This year died the good Bishop Athelwold,
the father of monks: and the consecration of his
successor Ælfheah, who was also called Godwin,
took place on the 14th of the calends of November,
and he was installed at Winchester on the
feast of the two Apostles Simon and Jude. And
this year Eadwine was consecrated Abbot of
Abingdon.</p>


<p class="center">985.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Ælfric was banished.</p>


<p class="center">986.</p>

<p>This year the King laid waste the Bishoprick
of Rochester, and this year the great distemper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>among the cattle first afflicted the English
nation.</p>


<p class="center">987.</p>

<p>This year Weced-port (Watchet) was plundered.</p>


<p class="center">988.</p>

<p>This year the Danish Thane Goda was killed,
and many with him. And this year the holy
Archbishop Dunstan gave up this life, and entered
upon that of heaven; and Bishop Æthelgar
succeeded him in the Archbishoprick, and he
lived but a short time afterwards, only one year
and three months.</p>


<p class="center">989.</p>

<p>This year the Abbot Ædwine died, and Wulfgar
succeeded him. And Siric was consecrated
Archbishop, and he afterwards went to Rome
for his pall.</p>


<p class="center">991.</p>

<p>This year Ipswich was plundered, and very
soon afterwards the Alderman Brihtnoth was
slain at Maiden. And the same year it was first
proposed that a tribute should be paid to the
Danes, because of the great terror in which they
kept the coasts. This tribute was at first ten
thousand pounds: it was Archbishop Siric who
gave this as his counsel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p class="center">992.</p>

<p>This year the blessed Archbishop Oswald departed
this life, and entered upon that of heaven;
and the Alderman Æthelwine died the same year.
Then the King and his Witan determined that
all the ships which were fit for service should be
assembled at London; and the King put this
fleet under the command of the Alderman Ealfric,
and of the Earl Thorode, and of the Bishops
Ælfstane and Æscwig, and they were ordered to
endeavour to surprise and block up the Danes.
Then the Alderman Ælfric sent and warned
them; and in the night preceding the day on
which an engagement would have taken place, he
himself left his fleet, to his exceeding dishonour,
and the enemy escaped, excepting one ship,
which was destroyed. And then they met the
ships of East Anglia and of London, and there
they made a great slaughter, and they took the
ship in which the Alderman sailed, and which
was well manned and fitted out.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Archbishop Oswald, Ealdulf
Abbot of Peterborough was raised to the
Bishoprick of York and Worcester, and Kenulf
to the Abbacy of Peterborough.</p>


<p class="center">993.</p>

<p>This, year Anlaf came to Staines with 93 ships,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>and plundered that part of the country; and he
went thence to Sandwich, and so on to Ipswich,
and laid all waste, and thus he proceeded to
Malden. And then the Alderman Byrhtnoth
came against him, and their armies fought, but
the Alderman was slain, and Anlaf’s army kept
possession of the field of battle, and peace was
made with him, and the King afterwards stood
godfather at his confirmation, by the advice of
Siric Bishop of Canterbury and of Ælfeag of
Winchester. This year Bamborough was destroyed,
and much plunder was seized there.
And after this the Army came to the mouth of the
Humber, and did great damage in Lindsey and
in Northumberland. Then a great number of
troops were gathered together, but when they
were about to engage in battle, their leaders first
betook themselves to flight. These were Fræna,
and Godwin, and Frithegist. The same year
the King put out the eyes of Ælfgar the son of
the Alderman Ælfric.</p>


<p class="center">994.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Sigeric died, and Ælfric
Bishop of Wiltshire was chosen as his successor
by King Æthelred and his Witan, at Ambresbyri
(Amesbury), on Easter-day. This year
Anlaf and Swegen came to London on the nativity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>of St. Mary, with 94 ships, and they attacked
the city vigorously, and they also attempted
to burn it with fire, but they suffered more
loss and injury than they could ever have looked
for from any townsmen, for the holy Mother of
God in her mercy manifested herself to the inhabitants,
and delivered them from their enemies.
And then these departed, and did as much damage
as any army might, burning, plundering,
and slaying, along the coasts of Essex, of Kent,
of Sussex, and of Hampshire. And at length
they took horses and rode far and wide wherever
they would, and they did unspeakable mischief.
Then the King and his Witan determined to send
to them and offer them tribute and a supply of
provisions, on condition that they would abstain
from plundering. This they accepted, and all
the army came to Southampton, and there they
took up their winter quarters, and all the kingdom
of Wessex provided food for them, and sixteen
thousand pounds were paid to them. Then
the King sent the Bishop Ælfeach and the Alderman
Æthelward for King Anlaf, and hostages
were left in the ships, while they brought him
with much pomp to the King at Andover; and
King Æthelred stood godfather at his confirmation,
and gave him royal presents. And Anlaf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>made him then a promise, which he also fulfilled,
that he would never again come with hostile
designs against the English nation.</p>

<p>“This year Richard the elder died, and his
son Richard succeeded him, and reigned 31
years” (in Normandy).</p>


<p class="center">995.</p>

<p>This year a comet appeared.</p>


<p class="center">997.</p>

<p>This year the Army sailed round Devonshire
into the mouth of the Severn, and plundered in
Cornwall, Wales, and Devon; and they landed
at Watchet, and did much damage there, burning
and slaying. And after this they sailed southward,
and round Penwiht-steort (the Land’s end),
and they entered the mouth of the Thamar, and
proceeded up that river until they came to Lydeford,
and they burned and slew all before them;
and they burned Ordulf’s monastery at Ætefingstoce
(Tavistock), and carried innumerable spoils
to their ships. This year Archbishop Ælfric
went to Rome for his pall.</p>


<p class="center">998.</p>

<p>This year the Army again turned eastward into
the mouth of the Frome, and they made inroads
upon Dorsetshire as far as they would on either
side. And troops were often gathered together
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>against them, but whenever they were about to
engage, from some cause or other, a flight constantly
took place, and the enemy always obtained
the victory in the end. At another time they
lay off the Isle of Wight, and supplied themselves
with provisions from Hampshire and
Sussex.</p>


<p class="center">999.</p>

<p>This year the Army again sailed round into the
Thames, and came up the Medway as far as
Rochester. And the Kentish troops marched
against them, and fought with them bravely:
but too soon, alas! they gave way and fled, because
they had not the support which they ought
to have had. Then the Danes kept possession of
the field of battle, and having seized horses they
rode far and wide wherever they chose, and they
plundered and laid waste nearly all the western
part of Kent. Then the King with his Witan
resolved that both a fleet and an army should be
sent against them; but when the ships were
ready, they delayed them from day to day, and
oppressed the miserable people who served in
them. And whenever the ships were going to
sail, they were always stopped from time to time,
and they allowed the enemy’s forces to increase
continually, and whenever these retired from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>coast, they then went forth after them. In the
end this fleet served no purpose, but to weary
the men, to waste money, and to encourage the
enemy.</p>


<p class="center">1000.</p>

<p>This year the King went into Cumberland and
laid waste nearly the whole of it; and his ships
attempted to get round Chester, and were to have
met him, but they were not able; then they plundered
Mænige (Anglesey). And the enemy’s
fleet sailed this summer to the dominions of
Richard.</p>


<p class="center">1001.</p>

<p>This year the peace of England was much
disturbed by the pirates, who plundered and
burned in all parts; and thus they proceeded in
one course until they came to Æthelinga-dene
(Alton), and there the men of Hampshire met
them, and fought with them. And the King’s
High Sheriff Ethelweard was killed there, and
Leofric of Whitechurch, and Leofwine the King’s
High Sheriff, and Wulfhere the Bishop’s Thane,
and Godwin of Weorthig (Worthing?) the son of
Bishop Ælfsig, and there fell 81 men in all. And
many more were slain on the part of the Danes, although
they kept possession of the field of battle.
And thence they proceeded northward until they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>came into Devon, and there Pallig joined them
with all the ships that he could collect, for he had
deserted from King Ethelred after all the assurances
of fidelity which he had given him, and although
the King had been very bountiful to him, in gifts
of houses, of gold, and of silver. And they
burned Tegnton (Teynton), and many other good
villages which we cannot name, and afterwards
the people of that country made a treaty with
them; and they departed thence to Exmouth,
and so they went on in one course until they
came to Peonnho (Pen), and there Cola the
King’s High Sheriff, and Eadsige the King’s
Sheriff, came against them with the troops which
they had gathered together, but they were put to
flight and many were slain, and the Danes kept
possession of the field of battle. And the next
morning they burned the villages of Pen and of
Clifton, and many good villages besides which
we cannot name. And then they proceeded eastward
until they arrived at Wight, and in the
morning they there burned the village of Wealtham
and many other hamlets, and the inhabitants
soon treated with them and obtained
peace.</p>


<p class="center">1002.</p>

<p>This year the King and his Witan again resolved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>to give tribute to the fleet, and to negociate
a peace with them, on condition that they
would cease from doing mischief. Then the King
sent the Alderman Leofsig to the fleet, and there
he set forth the King’s words, and the peace proposed
by the Witan, that they should receive
provisions and tribute; and they accepted these
terms, on which twenty-four thousand pounds
were paid to them. At this time the Alderman
Leofsig slew the King’s High Sheriff Æfic, and
the King banished him from the country. And
during the same Lent, the Lady the daughter of
Richard, came to this land. In the summer of
the same year Archbishop Eadulf (Ealdulf)
died: and this year also the King gave command
that all the Danes in England should be slain on
St. Brice’s day, because it had been reported to
him that they had a design to murder him first,
and then all his Witan, and thereupon to possess
his kingdom without opposition.</p>


<p class="center">1003.</p>

<p>This year Exeter was taken through the ill conduct
of the French churl Hugo, whom the Lady
had placed there as her Sheriff; and the Army
entirely destroyed the town, and seized much
plunder. Then a large number of troops was
gathered together from Wiltshire and Hampshire,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>and they marched against the Army with
great readiness; and the Alderman Ælfric should
have led these troops, but he practised his former
wiles, for as soon as they were so near that
either array might behold the other, he gave
out that he was ill, and feigned sickness, and
thus deceived the troops whom he ought to
have headed, even as it is said—“When the
General sickeneth, then the whole army is
sorely hindered.” When Swegn saw that they
were not unanimous and that they all began to
return, he led his army to Wilton, and plundered
and burned that town, and thence they
proceeded to Salisbury, and thence to the coast
again, and thither he carried their provender to
his horses of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a></p>


<p class="center">1004.</p>

<p>This year Swegn came with his fleet to Norwich,
and plundered and burned the whole town.
Then Ulfkytel with the Witan of East Anglia
concluded that it was better to buy a peace of
that army before they did much harm in the
country; for the enemy had come upon him unawares,
neither had he time to collect his troops;
but in the time of truce the Danes stole up from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>the ships and directed their course to Thetford.
When Ulfkytel heard this, he sent desiring that
the ships might be hewn in pieces, but this order
was neglected. He himself assembled troops
secretly, as speedily as he might. And the invaders
came to Thetford within three weeks from
the time that they first plundered Norwich, and
they remained one night in that town, and then
plundered and burned it. Then in the morning
when they would have returned to their ships,
Ulfkytel came up with his troops, and they engaged
in battle with fury, and the slaughter was
great on either side. The prime of East Anglia
fell there, but if all their forces had been collected,
the Danes, as they acknowledged, would never
have returned to their ships.</p>


<p class="center">1005.</p>

<p>This year died Archbishop Ælfric, and Bishop
Ælfeah succeeded him in the Archbishoprick.
This year there was a great famine in England,
such as men never before remembered, it was so
dreadful. And this year the fleet sailed from
this country to Denmark, but returned again in a
very short time.</p>


<p class="center">1006.</p>

<p>This year Ælfehg was consecrated Archbishop;
and Bishop Brihtwold received the bishoprick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>of Wiltshire (Sherborn). And Wulfgeate was
deprived of all his honours, and Wulfeah and
Ufegeat were blinded, and the Alderman Ælfelm
was slain, and Bishop Kenulf died. Then after
Midsummer the Danish fleet came to Sandwich
and did all as they were wont, plundering, burning,
and slaying wherever they went. Then the
King caused all the West Saxons and Mercians
to be called out, and they kept the field against
the Army all the autumn, yet this was of no more
avail than many times before, but for all this the
Army went where it would, and this campaign
did the inhabitants more injury than they had
ever before suffered from any force, native or
foreign. And in the beginning of winter the
troops returned home, and the enemy came after
Martinmas to their safe quarters in Wight, and
thence they procured for themselves whatever
they wanted from all parts. At mid-winter they
went forth to get supplies, and marched through
Hampshire into Berkshire, and they proceeded
as far as Reading, and they did as they were
wont and lighted their beacons wherever they
came. And thence they marched to Wallingford
and entirely destroyed that town, and passing
by Æsces-dune (Aston) they made for
Cwichelmes-hlæwe (Cuckamsley-hill), so that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>they never approached the sea, but returned
homeward the other way. Then the troops of
the country were assembled at Cynetan (Kennet),
and there they engaged in battle, and forthwith
the enemy put these troops to flight, and afterwards
carried their spoils to the sea. Then
might the inhabitants of Winchester see that
proud and fearless Army marching past their very
gates carrying with them to the sea provisions
and treasures from a distance of above fifty miles.
The King had crossed the Thames into Shropshire,
and there he kept the feast of Christmas.
Then the dread of the Army became so great,
that none could think or imagine how they might
be expelled from the country, or how this land
might be defended against them, for they had
grievously defaced every shire of Wessex with
burning and devastation. The King began anxiously
to enquire of his Witan what measures
they all thought advisable to be taken for the
preservation of this land before it was entirely
ruined. Then the King and his Witan agreed,
that, for the good of the people, they must pay
tribute, though they were all unwilling so to do.
Then the King sent to the Army, and caused it
to be told them that he desired that there should
be peace between them and him, and that tribute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>and provisions should be delivered to them; and
they all accepted these conditions, and they were
supported by the whole English nation.</p>


<p class="center">1007.</p>

<p>This year the tribute was paid to the Army;
it was thirty thousand pounds; and this year
also Ædric was appointed Alderman over all the
kingdom of Mercia.</p>


<p class="center">1008.</p>

<p>This year the King commanded that ships
should be built and fitted out with diligence
throughout England, at this assessment, one
vessel from every 310 hides of land, and from
eight hides a helmet and a breast-plate.</p>


<p class="center">1009.</p>

<p>This year the ships were ready of which we
have before spoken, and inasmuch as we learn
from books, so many were never constructed by
the English nation in any King’s days; and
they were all collected at Sandwich, that they
might lie off that port, and defend this land from
every foreigner. But yet the country had neither
the fortune nor honour to profit more by this
fleet than by former armaments.</p>

<p>It was at this time, or a little earlier, that
Brihtric the brother of the Alderman Edric accused
Childe Wulfnoth the South Saxon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>father of Earl Godwin before the King; on
which Wulfnoth departed, and got together
twenty ships, and plundered the whole southern
coast, and did all manner of evil. Then it was
said in the fleet that Wulfnoth might easily be
taken if the attempt were made, on which Brihtric
went forth with eighty ships, and he thought
that he should gain great fame, and that he
should bring back Wulfnoth alive or dead. But
as they were proceeding in search of him, such
a wind arose against them as had never been remembered,
and the ships were beaten about and
dispersed and driven ashore; and Wulfnoth immediately
came and burned them. When it was
known in the remainder of the fleet where the
King was, how the other ships had fared, it
seemed as if all plan and conduct were lost, and
the King, with the Aldermen and High-Witan,
returned home; thus lightly did they leave their
ships, and the people who were in them rowed
them back to London. And in this manner they
caused the effort of the whole nation to fail, and
the dread of the enemy was in no wise lessened,
as all the English people had hoped. When the
fleet was thus broken up, there came an immense
army of the enemy to Sandwich soon after Lammas,
and forthwith they went their way to Canterbury,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>and would speedily have stormed the
town, had not the inhabitants with greater speed
begged for peace, and all the men of East Kent
made a peace with that army, for which they
gave three thousand pounds. And soon after
this the army sailed round as far as Wight, and
they plundered and burned there as was their
wont, and also in Sussex, in Hampshire, and in
Berkshire. Then the King ordered all the nation
to arms, that every quarter might be defended
against them; nevertheless they went wherever
they would. At one time the King with all the
troops which he had collected, had intercepted
them as they were returning to their ships, but
when all his people were ready to fall upon
them, the attack was prevented as usual by the
Alderman Ædric. Then after Martinmas the
army returned into Kent, and took up their winter
quarters on the Thames, and lived upon
Essex and upon the neighbouring counties on
each side of that river; and they frequently attacked
London, but, God be praised, the town
yet stands in safety: for they ever failed in their
attempts against it. And after Christmas they
set out on an expedition through Chiltern, and
so to Oxford, and they burned that town, and
they plundered on each side of the Thames in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>returning towards the ships. But when they
were warned that troops were assembled at London
to oppose them, they passed over at Staines:
thus they went on all the winter, and they were
in Kent during Lent and repaired their ships.</p>


<p class="center">1010.</p>

<p>This year, after Easter, the aforesaid Army
invaded the Angles; they landed at Ipswich and
marched straight forward to the place where, as
they had heard, Ulfcytel was with his troops.
This was on the morning of Ascension-day, and
the East Anglians soon took to flight, but the
men of Cambridgeshire stood their ground firmly.
The King’s son in law Æthelstan was slain
there, and Oswi and his sons, and Wulfric the
son of Leofwin, and Eadwig the brother of
Æfic, and many other good Thanes, and more
than can be numbered of the common people.
Thurcytel Myranheafod began the flight, and
the Danes kept possession of the field of battle,
and there they obtained horses; and after this
they were masters of East Anglia, and they continued
to burn and plunder that country for the
space of three months, and they even penetrated
into the wild fens, and slew both men and cattle,
and they set all on fire, and they burned the
towns of Thetford and Cambridge; and then they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>returned southward to the Thames, the cavalry
keeping up with the ships; and very soon they
set forth again, and proceeded westward into Oxfordshire,
and thence into Buckinghamshire, and
so along the Ouse until they came to Bedford,
and thus on to Tempsford, burning wherever they
went; and then they returned to their fleet with
their plunder, and divided it amongst the ships.
And when the English troops ought to have
taken the field to repel the invaders they departed
home, and when the enemy was in the
east these were kept in the west, and when they
were in the south our troops were in the north.
Then all the Witan were summoned to the King,
to consult how this land might be defended, but
yet they persevered not for one month in any of
the plans determined on; and at length there was
no leader who would gather the troops together,
but every man fled as best he might, nor indeed
would any county unite with another. Then
before St. Andrew’s day the Army came to
Northampton, and forthwith burned that city,
and they seized all that they would in those
parts, and thence they crossed the Thames into
Wessex, and so along the Caningan marshes (Cannington,
Somersetshire?) and they set all on fire,
and having gone as far as they would for that
time, they returned to their ships at Christmas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p class="center">1011.</p>

<p>This year the King and his Witan sent to the
Army, and desired peace, promising tribute and
supplies of provision, on condition that they
should cease from plundering. At this time they
had overrun the following districts: 1st, East
Anglia; 2dly, Essex; 3dly, Middlesex; 4thly,
Oxfordshire; 5thly, Cambridgeshire; 6thly, Hertfordshire;
7thly, Buckinghamshire; 8thly, Bedfordshire;
9thly, half of Huntingdonshire; and
10thly, south of the Thames, all Kent, and
Sussex, and Hastings, and Surrey, Berkshire,
Hampshire, and great part of Wiltshire. All
these calamities befel us through ill-advisedness,
because tribute was not offered them sufficiently
soon; but when they had done all possible mischief,
we then compounded with them for peace
and quietness. Yet notwithstanding this treaty
and tribute, they went not forth the less frequently
in every direction, marching in separate
divisions, and carrying off or slaying our miserable
countrymen. And this year, between the
nativity of St. Mary and Michaelmas, they besieged
Canterbury, and gained an entrance
through treachery, for Ælmær, whose life had
been saved by Archbishop Ælfeah, betrayed the
town to them. And they seized the Archbishop
Ælfeah; and Ælfword the King’s sheriff, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>Abbot Leofwine, and Bishop Godwin, but they
let the Abbot Ælmær depart; and they took captive
all the consecrated persons men and women,
none could say how great was the number of prisoners,
and they remained in the town as long as
they would, and when they had ransacked it
thoroughly, they returned to their ships carrying
the Archbishop with them. He who erewhile
was the chiefest of the English nation, and of its
religion, was now a prisoner; and now might men
behold that wretched city the abode of misery,
wherein had been fullness of joy; and from
whence Christianity and blessedness had been first
sent forth to us, before God, and before the
world. And they kept the Archbishop with them
until the time that they martyred him.</p>


<p class="center">1012.</p>

<p>This year the Alderman Eadric and all the
chief of the Witan of the English nation, clergy
and laity, came to London before Easter day,
which fell on the 13th of April, and they remained
there after Easter, until all the tribute
was paid, it was 8000 pounds. Then on the
Saturday the Army was greatly exasperated
against the Archbishop, because he would not
promise them money, but forbade others to give
them any thing on his behalf; they were also very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>drunken, for wine was brought to them from the
south; then they took the Archbishop and led him
to their hustings on the eve of Sunday the octave
of Easter day, and there they pelted him with
the bones and skulls of cattle, and at length one
of them struck him upon the head with an iron
axe, so that he dropped down from the blow.
And his sacred blood was spilled upon the earth
but his holy soul departed to the kingdom of God.
And in the morning the Bishops Eadnoth and
Ælfhun and the townsmen took his holy body
and carried it to London with all reverence and
buried it in St. Paul’s Minster where God yet
maketh manifest the power of the blessed martyr.
When the tribute had been paid, and the oaths
of peace were sworn, the Army again dispersed
itself widely, as it had been gathered together
from various parts. And 45 of their ships entered
into the King’s service, and promised him
that they would defend this country, on condition
that he should feed and clothe them.</p>


<p class="center">1013.</p>

<p>The year after that in which Archbishop Ælfeg
was martyred, the King appointed Bishop Lifing
to the see of Canterbury. And the same year
before the month of August King Swegn arrived
with his fleet at Sandwich, and he coasted very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>rapidly round East Anglia and entered the mouth
of the Humber, and so proceeded up the Trent
until he came to Gainsborough. And in a short
time Earl Uhtred and all Northumberland and
the people of Lindsey submitted to him, and
afterwards the inhabitants of the five towns<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> did
likewise, and very soon after this all the forces
north of Watling-street submitted also, and hostages
were given him from each county. When
he found that all the people were subject to him
he commanded that they should supply his army
with horses and provisions, and he then proceeded
southward with a large force, leaving the
charge of his ships and hostages to his son Cnut.
And when they had passed Watling-street, they
did as much evil as any army might; he marched
to Oxford, and the town immediately surrendered
and gave hostages; thence he went to Winchester,
and the inhabitants of that place did the
same; thence he turned eastward towards London,
and many of his soldiers were drowned in
the Thames, not looking out for a bridge. And
when he came to the city the inhabitants would
not surrender, but they held out against him and
fought bravely, for King Æthelred was there,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>and Thurkil with him. Then King Swegn departed
thence to Wallingford, and so over the
Thames westward to Bath, and he rested there
with his army. And the Alderman Æthelmer
came thither, and all the western Thanes with
him, and they submitted themselves to King
Swegn, and gave hostages. And having thus
conquered the country, he returned to his ships
in the north, and all the people fully received
and acknowledged him as their true King. And
after this the men of London submitted to him
and gave hostages, for they feared lest he should
utterly ruin them. Then Swegn exacted an immense
tribute, and provision for his army during
that winter; and Thurcyl demanded the same
for the army at Greenwich; and besides this
they plundered as often as they would, to the
great injury of this people both in the south and
in the north. The King remained a little while
with the fleet in the Thames, and the Lady went
over sea to her brother Richard, and Ælsige
Abbot of Peterborough with her. And the King
sent Bishop Ælfun over sea with the Æthelings
Edward and Alfred, that he might take care of
them. And the King went from the fleet to
Wight at Christmas, and he remained there during
that festival; and then he departed over sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>to Richard, and he abode with him till Swegn
was dead. Whilst the Lady was beyond sea
with her brother, Ælfsige Abbot of Peterborough
who was with her, went to a monastery called
Bonneval, where the body of Saint Florentinus
lay. He found the place, and the Abbot, and
the monks in a condition of great misery, for
they had been plundered; and he bought of the
Abbot and the monks the whole of the remains
of Saint Florentinus, excepting his head, for five
hundred pounds; and when he returned home
he presented them to Christ and to Saint Peter.</p>


<p class="center">1014.</p>

<p>This year King Swegn ended his days at Candlemas,
on the 3d of the nones of February, and
the fleet chose Cnut as King. Then all the Witan
of the English nation, clergy and laity, determined
that they would send to King Æthelred,
and they assured him that no one was dearer to
them than their natural Lord, if he would govern
them more righteously than he did before. So
the King sent his son Edward hither with his
deputies, and commanded him to greet all his
people, and said that he would be their faithful
Lord, and that he would amend all that had
been complained of, and all that had been done
or said against himself should be forgiven, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>they would return to him with one consent and
without guile. And confidence was fully established
by words, deeds, and pledges, on either
side, and they outlawed for ever any Danish
King of England. In Lent King Æthelred came
home to his own people, and he was gladly
received by them all.</p>

<p>After the death of Swegn, Cnut and his army
remained at Gainsborough till Easter, and it was
agreed between him and the men of Lindsey that
the latter should furnish him with horses, and
that afterwards they should all go forth together
and plunder. Then King Æthelred with all his
troops marched into Lindsey before they were
prepared to oppose him, and he plundered and
burned, and he slew all the people that he found;
but Cnut the son of Swegn sailed away with his
fleet, and thus were these miserable people betrayed
by him, and he steered southward till he
came to Sandwich, and there he set on shore the
hostages that had been delivered to his father,
and he cut off their hands and noses. And besides
all these evils, the King ordered twenty-one
thousand pounds to be paid to the army at
Greenwich. And on the eve of Michaelmas-day
this year was that great inundation of the sea
over a wide extent of this land, which came up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>farther than was ever known before, and overwhelmed
many towns and an immense number of
persons.</p>


<p class="center">1015.</p>

<p>This year there was a great meeting (of the
Witan) at Oxford, and the Alderman Eadric betrayed
Sigeferth and Morcær the chief Thanes of
the seven towns,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[AS]</a> for he enticed them to his lodging,
and there they were basely murdered. And
the King seized all their possessions, and commanded
that the widow of Sigeferth should be
taken and carried to Malmesbury. And a short
time afterwards Prince Edmund went thither and
took her for his wife without the King’s consent.
Then before the feast of the nativity of St. Mary
the Prince went northward to the five towns, and he
forthwith attacked the Heritage of Sigeferth and
Morcær, and all the people submitted to him. And
at the same time Cnut came to Sandwich, and he
immediately sailed round Kent and along the coast
of Wessex till he came to the mouth of the Frome,
and he plundered in Dorset, Wiltshire and Somersetshire.
At that time King Æthelred lay sick
at Cosham. And the Alderman Edric assembled
an army and Prince Edmund also raised troops in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>the north, and when they joined forces the Alderman
would have betrayed the Prince, but he was
not able to do this, therefore they parted, and gave
place to the enemy without fighting. And then
the Alderman Edric drew off 40 ships from the
King’s party and went over to Cnut. And the
West Saxons also submitted to Cnut and gave
hostages, and furnished his army with horses, and
he remained there until Christmas.</p>


<p class="center">1016.</p>

<p>This year Cnut crossed the Thames into Mercia
at Cricklade with the forces of 160 ships,
and the Alderman Eadric was with him. And
they invaded Warwickshire at Christmas, and
there they plundered and burned, and they slew
all that they found. Then the Ætheling Edmund
began to gather troops together, but when they
were assembled they refused to serve unless the
King were present, and they had also a reinforcement
from the citizens of London: and thus
they set aside the expedition, and every man
departed to his home. After Christmas troops
were again levied, under a heavy penalty, that
even those who were at a distance must come
forth; and a message was sent to the King at
London, and he was desired to meet this Army
with all the force that he could muster: but this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>effort availed not more than the many former attempts,
for when they were all assembled it was
told the King that some<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[AT]</a> who ought to support
him would betray him, on which the Army was
broken up and he returned to London. Then
Prince Edmund rode to Northumberland to Earl
Uhtred, and all men thought that they would
raise an army to oppose King Cnut; but they
marched into Staffordshire, and to Shrewsbury,
and to Chester, and they plundered on their side
of the country, while Cnut did the same on his.
For he proceeded through Buckinghamshire into
Bedfordshire, and thence into Huntingdonshire,
and along the fens to Stamford, and then into
Lincolnshire, thence into Nottinghamshire, and
then into Northumberland and towards York.
And when Uhtred heard this he left off plundering
and hastened northward, and he yielded to necessity
and all Northumberland with him, and he
gave hostages, but nevertheless he was slain and
Thurcytel the son of Nafana with him. And after
this Cnut appointed Yric Earl of Northumberland
in like manner as Uhtred had been. And
then he returned southward another way by the
west; and thus the whole army came to the ships
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>before Easter. And Prince Edmund went to his
father at London. And after Easter King Cnut
sailed towards London with all his ships, but
King Æthelred was dead before they arrived
there. He died on St. George’s day, after a life
of much trouble and sorrow. After his death
all of the Witan who were in London and the
citizens chose Edmund, for their King, and
he valiantly defended his kingdom during his
whole life. Then the ships came to Greenwich
in Rogation week, and in a little while they proceeded
to London; they dug a great ditch on
the south side of the town and drew up their
ships west of the bridge, and they beset the town
so that none could go in or out. And they attacked
the city several times, but the inhabitants
withstood them resolutely.</p>

<p>And before this, King Edmund had gone
forth, and he marched into Wessex, and all the
people submitted to him, and soon after that, he
fought with the Army at Pen, near Gillingham.
And he fought another battle after Midsummer,
at Sceorstan,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a> and there many fell on either side,
and the armies separated of their own accord.—The
Alderman Eadric, and Ælmær the Beloved,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>were with the Danes against King Edmund.—And
then he raised an army for the third time,
and marched to London and rescued the inhabitants,
and he drove their enemies to the ships.
And within two days he crossed the river at
Brentford and fought with the Army, and put it
to flight, but many of the English were drowned
through their own heedlessness, because they had
hastened before the main body, being greedy of
plunder. And after this the King went into
Wessex and assembled troops, and the Army
marched to London and encamped round about
the town, and they attacked it vigorously by
water and by land, but Almighty God delivered
it; and they navigated their ships from London
into the Arwan (the Arrow), and they landed
and went up into Mercia, slaying and plundering
all before them as was their wont, and they supplied
themselves with provisions and conveyed
their ships and cattle to the Medway. Then
King Edmund assembled all the English people
for the fourth time, and crossed the Thames at
Brentford and marched into Kent, and the Danes
fled before him with their horses into Sheppey,
and the King slew all whom he could overtake;
and at Aylesford the Alderman Eadric turned the
King from the pursuit: more treacherous advice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>than this never was given. The Army went up
again into Essex, and thence into Mercia, destroying
all things wherever they came. And
when the King knew that they were on their
march, he assembled all the English troops for
the fifth time, and followed after them, and he
came up with them in Essex, at the place called
Assandun,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a> and there they fought furiously.—But
the Alderman Eadric acted as he had often
done before; he was the first to take to flight
with the Magesætas (men of Radnorshire), and
thus he betrayed his natural Lord and all the
people. There Cnut gained the victory, though
all England fought against him. And Eadnoth<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a>
and the Abbot Wulsige were slain there, and the
Alderman Ælfric, and the Alderman Godwin,
and Ulfcytel of East Anglia, and Æthelward
the son of the Alderman Æthelsig, and all the
prime of the English nobility. After this battle
King Cnut marched his army into Gloucestershire,
having heard that King Edmund was in
that quarter. Then the Alderman Eadric and
those of the Witan who were there, advised that
the Kings should make peace between themselves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>and the Kings met at Olan-ige (Alney), and
there they confirmed their alliance by pledges
and oaths; and they agreed upon the tribute for
the Army. And when this treaty was concluded
they separated; King Edmund going into Wessex,
and Cnut into Mercia. The Army returned
to their ships with the spoil which they had gained,
and the men of London treated with them, and
bought peace, and the Danes brought their ships
into London, and there they took up their winter
quarters. Then on St. Andrew’s day, King Edmund
died, and he was buried with his grandfather
Edgar at Glastonbury. And the same
year Wulfgar Abbot of Abingdon died, and he
was succeeded by Æthelsige.</p>

<p>This year<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[AX]</a> King Cnut took to himself the
whole kingdom of England, and he divided it
into four parts, reserving to himself the government
of Wessex, and committing East Anglia
to Thurcyll, Mercia to Eadric, and Northumberland
to Yric. This year the Alderman Eadric
was slain, and Northman also the son of the
Alderman Leofwin, and Æthelword the son of
Æthelmær the Great, and Brihtric the son of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>Ælfget of Devonshire. And King Cnut banished
Ædwig the Ætheling, and Eadwig the King
of the Peasants. Then before the calends of
August he sent for the widow of the late King
Æthelred, the daughter of Richard, to be his
Queen.</p>


<p class="center">1018.</p>

<p>This year a tribute was levied throughout
England; it amounted in all to seventy-two thousand
pounds, besides that paid by the citizens
of London, which was eleven thousand pounds.
Then a part of the Army returned to Denmark;
but forty ships remained with King Cnut; and
the Danes and English came to an agreement<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[AY]</a>
at Oxford. And this year Æthelsige Abbot of
Abingdon died, and Æthelwine succeeded him.</p>


<p class="center">1019.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut went to Denmark, and
remained there all the winter.</p>


<p class="center">1020.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut returned to England;
and during Easter a great meeting was held at
Cirencester, at which the Alderman Æthelword
was outlawed. And this year the King went to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>Assandun, and caused a Minster<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[AZ]</a> to be built
of stone and lime, for the souls of those who
were slain there, and he gave it to one of his
priests whose name was Stigand. And Archbishop
Living died, and Æthelnoth a monk and Deacon
of Christ Church was consecrated Bishop of that
diocese the same year by Archbishop Wulstan.</p>


<p class="center">1021.</p>

<p>This year at Martinmas King Cnut outlawed
Earl Thurkil.</p>


<p class="center">1022.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut sailed with his ships to
Wight. And Bishop Ælhelnoth journeyed to
Rome, and was very honourably received by
Pope Benedict, who put on his pall with his own
hands, and consecrated him Archbishop with
much pomp. And he performed mass clad in
the same pall, even as the Pope desired; and
after this he banqueted with the Pope: and at
length he returned home with a full blessing.—And
the Abbot Leofwin, who had been unjustly
banished from Ely, was his companion, and he
cleared himself of all that had been alledged
against him, in the presence of the Archbishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>and of all the company that was with him, as the
Pope instructed him.</p>


<p class="center">1023.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Wulfstan died. Ælfric
succeeded him, and Archbishop Ægelnoth consecrated
him at Canterbury. And the same year
Archbishop Ægelnoth brought the relics of the
Archbishop St. Ælfeg from London to Canterbury.</p>


<p class="center">1024.</p>

<p>“This year Richard 2d died: then his son
Richard reigned nearly one year, and after him
his brother Robert eight years.”</p>


<p class="center">1025.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut sailed to Denmark, and
thence to an island near the river Helga,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[BA]</a> and
there Ulf and Eglaf came against him with a
great fleet and army from Sweden. And very
many fell on the side of King Cnut, both Danes
and English, and the Swedes remained in possession
of the field of battle.</p>


<p class="center">1028.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut sailed from England to
Norway with fifty ships of English Thanes, and
he expelled King Olaf and took possession of
that land.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p class="center">1029.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut returned home to England.</p>


<p class="center">1030.</p>

<p>This year King Olaf returned to Norway, and
the people rose against him, and fought with
him, and he was slain.</p>


<p class="center">1031.</p>

<p>This year as soon as King Cnut came to England,
he granted to Christ’s Church, in Canterbury,
the harbour of Sandwich with all the profits
therefrom arising, on either side of the haven,
to this distance, namely, that when the tide runs
highest and is fully in, and a ship can ride as
near the shore as possible, a man should stand in
the ship holding a small axe in his hand, “and
as far as he could throw this axe on shore, so far
should their rights extend.” This year King
Cnut journeyed to Rome, and the same year after
his return he went into Scotland, and the Scotch
King Malcolm, with two other Kings, Mælbæthe
and Iehmarc, submitted to him. And Robert
Earl of Normandy went to Jerusalem and died
there, and he was succeeded in Normandy by
William then a child, who was afterwards King
of England.</p>


<p class="center">1032.</p>

<p>This year there were terrible lightnings, such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>as men remembered not before, and which caused
much damage in various places throughout the
country. And the same year Ælfsige Bishop of
Winchester died, and the King’s priest Ælfwine
received that bishoprick.</p>


<p class="center">1033.</p>

<p>This year Merehwit Bishop of Somerset died,
and he is buried at Glastonbury.</p>


<p class="center">1034.</p>

<p>This year died Bishop Ætheric.</p>


<p class="center">1036.</p>

<p>This year King Cnut died at Shaftesbury, and
he is buried in the old monastery of Winchester.
He was King over all England nearly 20 years;
and soon after his death a meeting of all the
Witan was held at Oxford, and Earl Leofric,
and almost all the Thanes north of the Thames,
and the seamen of London, chose Harold to govern
all England, both in his own right, and
for his brother Hardacnut, who was then in Denmark.
And Earl Godwin and all the chief men
of Wessex opposed them as long as they could;
but they could not prevail against them. Then
it was resolved that Ælfgiva the mother of Hardacnut
should reside at Winchester, with the
King her son’s household, and should hold the
government of Wessex for him. Earl Godwin
was the head man of that party. Some men say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>of Harold that he was the son of King Cnut and
of Ælfgiva the daughter of the Alderman Ælfelm;
but this is thought very unlikely by many.
Be this as it may, he was sole King of all England.</p>


<p class="center">1037.</p>

<p>This year Ælfgiva the widow of King Cnut
and mother of Edward and King Hardacnut, was
banished, and she sought an asylum with Baldwin
oversea in the south, and he gave her a residence
in Bruges, and he protected and maintained
her as long as she was there.</p>


<p class="center">1038.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Æthelnoth died on the
calends of November; and within a short time
Æthelric Bishop of Sussex died also; and then
before Christmas Brihteh Bishop of Worcestershire;
and very soon after that Ælfric Bishop of
East Anglia. Then Bishop<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[BB]</a> Eadsige succeeded
to the Archbishoprick; Grymcytel received the
Bishoprick of Sussex; and Living that of Worcestershire
and Gloucestershire.</p>


<p class="center">1039.</p>

<p>This year King Harold died at Oxford on the
16th of the calends of April, and he was buried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>at Westminster: he governed England four years
and sixteen weeks, and in his reign a tax was
raised for (keeping up a fleet of) 16 ships, at
the rate of eight marks to every sailor, even as
it had been in the days of King Cnut. And the
same year King Hardacnut arrived at Sandwich
seven days before Midsummer, and he was forthwith
received as King by the English and by
the Danes: but those who promoted his accession
paid dearly for it afterwards. Then they
determined upon raising a tax to keep up a fleet
of 62 ships, at the rate of eight marks for every
sailor. And the same year the sæster of wheat
sold for 55 pennies and even more.</p>


<p class="center">1040.</p>

<p>This year Archbishop Eadsige journeyed to
Rome, and this year the army-tribute was paid;
it was twenty-one thousand and ninety-nine
pounds: and eleven thousand and forty-eight
pounds were afterwards paid for 32 ships. And
the same year Edward the son of King Æthelred
came hither from abroad;<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[BC]</a> he was a brother of
King Hardacnut, for they both were sons of
Ælfgiva Emma the daughter of Earl Richard.</p>


<p class="center">1041.</p>

<p>This year King Hardacnut died at Lambeth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>on the 6th of the ides of June. He was King
over all England two years all but ten days, and
he was buried with his father King Cnut in the
old monastery at Winchester; and his mother
gave the head of the martyr Saint Valentine for
his soul’s sake to the new monastery. And before
he was buried all the people chose Edward King
in London, and he held the kingdom as long as
God permitted him. And all this year was a
very heavy time in many different ways, from the
inclemency of the weather, and from the destruction
of the fruits of the earth. So many of the
cattle also perished this year both from disease,
and from the ill season, as had never before been
remembered. At this time Ælfsige Abbot of
Peterborough died, and the monk Arnwi was
chosen in his place, because he was a good man,
and one of a singular simplicity.</p>


<p class="center">1042.</p>

<p>On Easter-day, this year, Edward was consecrated
King with great worship at Winchester.
Easter then fell on the 3d of the nones of April.
The Archbishop Eadsige consecrated him, and
instructed him well before all the people, and
admonished him for his own good and that of the
nation. And the Priest Stigand was consecrated
Bishop of East Anglia. And soon afterwards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>the King gave command to over-ride the lands
which his mother held of him, and he took from
her all that she possessed in gold and silver, and
treasures innumerable, because she had not been
liberal towards him.</p>


<p class="center">1043.</p>

<p>This year Eadsige gave up his Archbishoprick,
because of his infirmities, and he consecrated
thereto Siward Abbot of Abingdon, with the
consent and advice of the King and of Earl Godwin.
This transaction was disclosed to few before
it was completed, because the Archbishop
thought that if it became known to many, some
other man in whom he trusted and confided less,
would beg or buy the preferment. And this
year there was a very great famine over all England,
and corn was so dear as was never before
remembered, so that a sæster of wheat sold for
60 pennies, and even more. And the same year
the King went out to Sandwich with a fleet of
35 ships. And the Churchwarden Æthelstan was
made Abbot of Abingdon. And Stigand entered
upon his Bishoprick.</p>

<p>It was in this year (1043) that Edward took
for his Queen the daughter of Earl Godwin.—The
same year died Brihtwold; he had held his
Bishoprick, that of Sherbourne, 38 years, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>the King’s Priest Hereman succeeded him. And
this year Wulfric was chosen Abbot of Saint
Augustine’s (Canterbury) at Christmas time, on
St. Stephen’s day, with the consent of the King
and of the Abbot Ælfstan, because of the great
infirmities of the latter.</p>


<p class="center">1044.</p>

<p>This year Living Bishop of Devonshire died,
and the King’s Priest Leofric succeeded him.—And
this year Ælfstan Abbot of St. Augustine’s
died on the 3d of the nones of July. And the
same year Osgot Clapa was banished.</p>


<p class="center">1045.</p>

<p>This year Grymkytel Bishop of Sussex died,
and Heca the King’s Priest succeeded him.—And
this year Ælfwine Bishop of Winchester
died on the 4th of the calends of September, and
Bishop Stigand was translated from the north to
that see. And the same year Earl Swegn went
out to Bruges in the land of Baldwin, and he
abode there all the winter, and departed thence
in the summer.</p>


<p class="center">1046.</p>

<p>This year Æthelstan Abbot of Abingdon died,
and Spearhafoc, a monk of St. Edmund’s Bury,
succeeded him. And this year Bishop Siward
died, and Archbishop Eadsige resumed the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>diocese. And the same year Lothen and Yrling
came to Sandwich with 25 ships, and they plundered,
and collected spoils innumerable, seizing
men, gold and silver, so that no man knew what
the whole amount was. And they sailed round
about Thanet, and would have done the same
there, but the inhabitants made a stout resistance,
and kept them from landing and from entering
the river, and wholly put them to flight;
and then they came upon Essex, and there they
plundered, and carried off men and whatever
they could find; and thence they bent their
course eastward to the land of Baldwin, and they
sold their booty there, and then they returned to
the east whence they came.</p>

<p>“Battle of Val des Dunes.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[BD]</a></p>

<p>In this year (1046) the great synod was held
at St. Remy, at which the Pope Leo was present,
with the Archbishop of Burgundy, the
Archbishop of Besançon, the Archbishop of
Treves, and the Archbishop of Rheims, and
many other wise men besides, both clergy and
laity: and King Edward sent Bishop Dudoc
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>thither with Wulfric Abbot of St. Augustine’s,
and the Abbot Ælfwine, to the end that they
might report to him what was there determined
upon with regard to the Christian religion.</p>

<p>The same year King Edward went out to Sandwich
with a large fleet, and Earl Swegn came
with seven ships to Boseham, and treated with
the King, and it was promised him that he should
be put in possession of all that he had before;
then his brother Earl Harold and Earl Beorn
interfered, and prevented his enjoying the King’s
grant, and four days were allowed for his return
to the ships. In the mean while word was
brought to the King that an hostile fleet lay off
the west, and was plundering. Then Earl Godwin
sailed westward with two of the King’s
ships, one of which was commanded by Earl
Harold, and the other by his brother Tostig, and
with 42 of the ships furnished by the people.—Then
Earl Harold was removed from the king’s
ship which he had commanded, and they sailed
as far as Pevensey, and lay there weather-bound.
And within two days Earl Swegn came thither
and spake with his father and with Earl Beorn,
who was then with Godwin; and he entreated
Beorn that he would go with him to the King
at Sandwich, and assist him in obtaining the
King’s favour: and Beorn consented to this, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>they departed as if they would go to the King.
But, as they rode along, Swegn begged him to
go with him to his ships, for he feared that his
sailors would desert unless he returned speedily:
and they both proceeded to the place where the
ships lay at anchor, and when they came thither
Earl Swegn desired Beorn to go on board with
him; this he wholly refused, until the sailors
seized him, and threw him into a boat, and
bound him, and rowed to the ships, and put him
in one of them. Then they hoisted sail, and
proceeded westward to Exmouth; and they kept
him with them until they slew him, and they took
his body and buried it in a church. His friends
and the seamen of London afterwards came and
took it up again, and carried it to the old monastery
at Winchester, and there he is buried
beside his uncle King Cnut. And Swegn went
away eastward to the land of Baldwin, with
whose full leave he abode at Bruges during the
whole winter. And the same year died Eadnoth
Bishop in the north,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[BE]</a> and Ulf was appointed his
successor.</p>


<p class="center">1047.</p>

<p>This year a great council was held at London
in the middle of Lent, and nine of the ships belonging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>to the seamen were sent out, and five
were left there. And the same year Earl Swegn
came to England. And a great synod was assembled
at Rome this year, and King Edward
sent thither the Bishops Hereman and Ealdred,
and they arrived on Easter eve. And after this
the Pope held a synod at Vercelli; and Bishop
Ulf came there, and his staff would have been
broken, if he had not given large sums of
money; for he did not know his office so well as
he ought. This year Archbishop Eadsige died
on the 4th of the calends of November.</p>


<p class="center">1048.</p>

<p>This year, during Lent, King Edward being
in London, nominated Robert Archbishop of
Canterbury. And the same Lent he went to
Rome for his pall. And the King gave the
Bishoprick of London to Sparhafoc Abbot of
Abingdon, and the Abbacy of Abingdon to his
kinsman Bishop Rothulf. The Archbishop returned
from Rome one day before the eve of
the feast of St. Peter, and he was installed in
Christ Church on St. Peter’s day, and immediately
afterwards he proceeded to the King. Then
the Abbot Sparhafoc came to him with the King’s
letters and seal, to the intent that he should consecrate
him Bishop of London. But the Archbishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>refused, and said that the Pope had forbidden
it: the Abbot endeavoured to persuade the
Archbishop, and he earnestly desired the promotion,
but the other constantly denied him, still
saying that the Pope had forbidden it. The Abbot
notwithstanding returned to London, and resided
there in the diocese which the King had granted
him all the summer and autumn, and this with
his full permission. And Eustace arrived from
beyond sea soon after the Archbishop, and he
proceeded to the King and spoke with him all
that he would, and then he journeyed homeward.
When they had gone as far east as Canterbury
he and his men rested to eat, and thence
they went on to Dover. And when he was a mile
or more from Dover he put on his breast-plate,
and so did all his followers; and they came to
Dover. And when they were there, they would
fix on their quarters according to their own pleasure,
and one of his men came, and would have
lodged in the house of a certain person against
his will, and he wounded the master of the house,
but the householder slew him. Then Eustace
mounted his horse, and his followers theirs, and
they fell upon and slew the householder on
his own hearth. And thence they went towards
the town, and they killed within and without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>more than twenty men. And on the other
hand the townsmen slew nineteen of Eustace’s
train, and wounded they knew not how many.
And Eustace got off with a few others, and returned
again to the King, and related partially
what had occurred. And the King was very
angry with the townsmen, and he sent Earl Godwin,
commanding him to march into Kent, and
to take vengeance upon Dover; for Eustace had
told the King that the townsmen were more
in fault than himself, but it was not so, neither
was the Earl consenting to this expedition,
for he was unwilling to ruin his own vassals.—Then
the King sent for all his Witan, and desired
that they should come to him at Gloucester,
soon after St. Mary’s day. At this time the
Welch had built a castle in Herefordshire, in the
territory of Earl Swegn, and they did all manner
of despite and injury to the King’s subjects
in the neighbourhood. Then Earl Godwin, and
the Earls Swegn and Harold, and many with
them, met at Beverston, that they might proceed
to their liege Lord and his Witan then assembled,
and that they might obtain their advice
and aid for avenging this insult offered to the
King and all his people. But the Welch were
with the King beforehand, and accused the Earls,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>so that they were not admitted into his presence,
because the others had said, that they were
coming with treasonous designs against the King.
Earl Siward and Earl Leofric and a great number
of men from the north had joined the King,
and it was told Earl Godwin and his sons that
the King and those who were with him, were
about to attack them, on which they fortified
themselves strongly, albeit they were loth to act
against their natural Lord. Then the Witan on
either side advised that they should abstain from
hostilities, and the King gave the peace of God
and his own full friendship to both parties.—Then
the King and his Counsellors determined
that another meeting of all the Witan should be
held at London, at the autumnal equinox: and
the King commanded that an army, as powerful
as might be, should be raised both from the south
and from the north of the Thames. Earl Swegn
was declared an outlaw, and Earl Godwin and
Earl Harold were summoned to be at the meeting
with as much speed as they could make. When
they were come thither, they were called before the
Council, and they desired hostages and security
that they might go in and out of the Council
safe from treachery; and the King demanded all
the Thanes whom the Earls had with them, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>they delivered them all into his hands. Then
the King sent to them again, and desired that
they should come into the Council with twelve
attendants, but the Earl again desired security
and hostages, that so he might clear himself from
every charge which had been brought against
him; but these hostages were finally denied him,
and five days were allowed him, in which he
was to depart from the country. Then Earl
Godwin and Earl Swegn went to Boseham, and
they put to sea, and sought shelter with Baldwin,
and they abode in his land the whole winter.
And Earl Harold sailed westward to Ireland,
and remained there through the winter, under the
protection of the king of that country. And as
soon as all this had happened, the King sent away
the Lady, who had been consecrated as his Queen;
and he caused all that she possessed of gold, and
of silver, and of every other thing, to be taken
from her; and he put her under the charge of his
sister at Wherwell (in Hampshire). And the Abbot
Sparhafoc was driven from the Bishoprick of
London, and the King’s Priest William was consecrated
thereto. And Odda was appointed Earl
of Devon, Somerset, and Dorset, and of Wales;
and the Earldom which Harold had enjoyed was
given to Ælfgar the son of Leofric.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p class="center">1052.</p>

<p>This year died Ælfgiva Ymma the mother of
King Edward and of King Hardacnut. And
the same year the King and his Witan resolved
that a fleet should be assembled at Sandwich,
and they appointed the Earls Raulf and Odda
to command it. Then Earl Godwin went with
his ships from Bruges to Ysera (the Ysere?), and
thence after one day’s voyage he arrived at the
Ness south of Romney on Midsummer’s eve.—The
Earls who were stationed at Sandwich were
informed of his arrival, and they sailed in pursuit
of him, and a land army was also called out
to oppose him. But in the mean time Earl Godwin
was warned of their intentions, and he put
into Pevensey, and the weather was very stormy,
so that the Earls could not find out whither he
was gone; and Earl Godwin sailed out again
and went back to Bruges, and the other ships
returned to Sandwich. Then it was advised that
the fleet should be brought back to London, and
that other Earls and officers should be appointed,
but they delayed so long that all the ships separated
and returned home. When Earl Godwin
heard this, he set sail and hastened westward to
Wight, and there they landed and plundered
until the inhabitants gave them as much money as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>they chose to exact. And thence they proceeded
westward, till they came to Portland, and there
they landed, and did all the mischief that they
could. At this time Harold had left Ireland
with nine ships, and he arrived at Porlock, and
a large body of the inhabitants were collected to
oppose him; nevertheless he feared not to go in
quest of provisions, and he landed and slew a
great number of these people, and seized whatever
fell in his way, cattle, men, and money.—And
thence he proceeded eastward to join his
father, and they sailed together to Wight, and
there they seized whatever had been left before.
Thence they sailed to Pevensey, and they took
away with them as many ships as were in the
harbour: thus they proceeded to the Ness, and
they took with them all the ships that were at
Romney, Hythe, and Folkestone; and thence
they turned eastward to Dover, and there they
landed, and obtained as many ships and hostages
as they would; and so they proceeded to Sandwich,
and they did the same there, and the
people every where gave them the hostages and
provisions that they demanded. And from this
place they made for the North Mouth (Buoy of
the Nore); and so they proceeded towards London;
but some of the ships stopped at Sheppey,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>and did much damage there, and at King’s Milton
also, and they burned that town, and then
they followed the Earls to London. When they
were come to London, the King and all his Earls
had stationed themselves with fifty ships to oppose
them. Then the Earls sent to the King,
and desired that all their possessions of which
they had been unjustly deprived should be restored
to them: this demand the King resisted
for some time, even so long, that all the people
who were with the Earls became furiously enraged
against him and his party; so that the
Earls themselves scarcely quieted them. At
length, by God’s help, and the intervention of
Bishop Stigand, and wise men from the city
and the country, an exchange of hostages was
brought about. When Archbishop Robert and
the French heard this, they took their horses
and rode away, some westward to Pentecost’s
Castle, and others northward to Robert’s. And
Archbishop Robert and Bishop Ulf and their
train rode out at the east gate, and slew or
wounded many young men, and they proceeded
to Ealdulf’s-ness (the Nase, Essex), and the
Archbishop embarked in a mean little vessel and
went away beyond sea, and he left his pall and
his Archbishoprick in this land, even as God
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>willed, since he had at first obtained the same
in a manner that pleased not Him. Then a great
Council was convened out of London, and all
the Earls and the chief men of England were at
this meeting: Earl Godwin there took up the
word, and he protested before his Lord King
Edward and the people of this land that he was
guiltless of all that was charged against him,
and against his son Harold, and all his children.
And the King restored to the Earl and his children
his full friendship, and his whole Earldom,
and all that had belonged to him: and he granted
the same pardon to the men who were with
him: and the King gave the Lady all that she
possessed before. And Archbishop Robert and
all the Frenchmen were fully outlawed, because
they had been the chief promoters of the difference
between Earl Godwin and the King. And
Bishop Stigand was translated to the Archbishoprick
of Canterbury. And at this time Arnwi
Abbot of Peterborough, being in sound health,
gave up the Abbacy to the monk Leofric, with
the consent of the King and of the monks, and
he lived eight years afterwards. And the Abbot
Leofric gilded the monastery, so that men called
it Golden Borough; and it became very rich in
lands, in gold, and in silver.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p class="center">1053.</p>

<p>This year Earl Godwin died on the 17th of the
calends of May, and he is buried in the old
monastery of Winchester. And his son Earl
Harold succeeded to the Earldom, and to all that
his father possessed, and Earl Ælfgar received
Harold’s Earldom.</p>


<p class="center">1054.</p>

<p>This year Leo the Holy Pope of Rome died.
And this year there was a great murrain amongst
the cattle, such as men remembered not for many
winters before. And Victor was chosen Pope.</p>

<p>“Battle of Mortemer.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[BF]</a></p>


<p class="center">1055.</p>

<p>This year Earl Siward died. And a meeting
of all the Witan was appointed seven days before
Mid-Lent. And there Earl Ælfgar was outlawed,
for he was accused as a traitor to his
King and all the nation, and he was convicted
before the King and all who were there assembled,
though the sentence grieved him sorely.—And
the King gave the Earldom which Siward
had held to Tostig the son of Earl Godwin.—And
Earl Ælfgar went to the castle of Griffin in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>North Wales; and the same year Griffin and
Ælfgar burned St. Æthelbryht’s monastery and
the whole town of Hereford.</p>


<p class="center">1056.</p>

<p>“This year Henry Emperor of the Romans
died, and was succeeded by his son Henry.”</p>


<p class="center">1057.</p>

<p>This year Prince Edward the son of King Edmund
came to this land, and he died soon afterwards,
and his body is buried in St. Paul’s
monastery at London. And Pope Victor died,
and Stephen Abbot of Monte-Cassino was chosen
as his successor. And Earl Leofric died, and
his son Ælfgar succeeded to his father’s Earldom.</p>


<p class="center">1058.</p>

<p>This year Stephen died, and Benedict was consecrated
Pope: the same sent hither a pall to
Archbishop Stigand. And this year Heaca
Bishop of the South Saxons died; and Archbishop
Stigand consecrated Ægelric a monk of
Christ Church to that Bishoprick, and the Abbot
Siward to that of Rochester.</p>


<p class="center">1059.</p>

<p>This year Nicholas Bishop of Florence was
chosen Pope, and Benedict the former Pope was
driven out.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p class="center">1060.</p>

<p>This year Kynsige Archbishop of York died
on the 11th of the calends of January, and
Bishop Ealdred succeeded him: and Walter received
the Bishoprick of Hereford.</p>

<p>“This year Henry King of France died, and
was succeeded by his son Philip.”</p>


<p class="center">1061.</p>

<p>This year Duduc Bishop of Somerset died,
and was succeeded by Gisa. And this year
Bishop Godwin died at St. Martin’s (Canterbury),
on the 7th of the ides of March. And
the same year Wulfric Abbot of St. Augustine’s
died in Easter week, on the 14th of the calends
of May. When word was brought to the King
that the Abbot had departed this life, he chose
Æthelsig a monk of the old monastery (of Winchester)
to succeed him, and he repaired to
Archbishop Stigand, and was consecrated Abbot
at Windsor on St. Augustine’s day.</p>


<p class="center">1062.</p>

<p>“This year the province of Maine was brought
into subjection to William Earl of Normandy.”</p>


<p class="center">1063.</p>

<p>This year Earl Harold and his brother Earl
Tostig invaded Britain<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[BG]</a> with an army, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>fleet, and they conquered the country; and the
inhabitants gave hostages and submitted to them,
and afterwards they went and slew their King
Griffin, and brought his head to Harold, and he
set another King over them.</p>


<p class="center">1064.</p>

<p>This year the Northumbrians assembled together,
and outlawed Tostig their Earl, and they
slew all his retainers whom they could meet with,
both English and Danes: and they seized all his
arms at York, and his gold, and his silver, and
all his treasures that they could find. And they
sent for Morker the son of Earl Ælfgar, and
chose him for their Earl; and he marched southward
with the troops of that country, and of
Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire,
till he arrived at Northampton; and his brother
Edwin joined him with the men of his Earldom,
and many Britons also came with him. Then
they were met by Earl Harold, and they charged
him with a message to King Edward, and they
also sent deputies with him, and they desired
that they might have Morker for their Earl.—And
the King granted this, and sent Harold
again to them at Northampton on the eve of St.
Simon and St. Jude’s day, and he reported the
same to them, and put into their hands the King’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>assent, and there he renewed the laws of Canute.
And the northern men did much damage about
Northampton whilst he was gone on their errand,
for they slew men, and burned houses and corn,
and took all the cattle they could find, being
many thousand head, and many hundred men
did they seize and carry off into the north; so
that this county, and the others adjoining, were
the worse for them during many years. And
Earl Tostig and his wife, and all who were
of his party, went over sea southward to Earl
Baldwin, and he received them all, and they remained
there the whole winter.</p>


<p class="center">1066.</p>

<p>This year the Abbey Church of Westminster
was consecrated on Childermas-day. And this
year King Edward died on the eve of Twelfth-day,
and he was buried on Twelfth-day, in the
Church of Westminster, newly consecrated.—And
Earl Harold succeeded to the kingdom,
even as the King had granted it to him; men,
also chose him thereto, and he was consecrated
King on Twelfth-day, and reigned forty weeks
and one day. And the same year that he was
made King, he went out with a fleet against William;
and in the mean time Earl Tostig entered
the Humber with 60 ships, but Earl Edwin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>came up with his troops and drove him away,
and the crews of his vessels also deserted him.
Then he went to Scotland with twelve smacks;
and Harold King of Norway joined him with
300 ships, to whom Tostig gave up the command,
and they entered the Humber together,
and proceeded to York: and the Earls Morker
and Edwin fought with them, and the Norwegian
King gained the victory. King Harold,
being informed of what had passed, came with
a great army of Englishmen, and he met the
King of Norway at Stæng-fordes-brycge (Stanford
bridge), and he slew him and the Earl Tostig,
and routed their whole army.</p>

<p>And in the mean time Earl William landed
at Hastings on Michaelmas-day, and Harold
marched from the North, and fought with him
before all his own army had come up, and he
fell there with his two brothers, Gyrth and Leofwin.
And William conquered this land, and he
came to Westminster, and the Archbishop Ealdred
consecrated him King, and men paid him
tribute, and gave him hostages, and afterwards
bought their lands again.</p>

<p>Leofric Abbot of Peterborough was in this
campaign, and whilst he was with the army he
became ill, and he returned home, and died soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>after on All Saints’ night. May God glorify his
soul! In his days was all bliss and all prosperity
at Peterborough, and he was beloved of all men,
so that the King granted to St. Peter and to him
the Abbey of Burton, and that of Coventry which
his uncle Earl Leofric had founded, and also
those of Croyland and Thorney. And he enriched
the monastery of Burh with gold, with silver, with
vestments, and with lands, more than any other
before or after him. And the Golden Borough
now became the borough of wretchedness. Then
the monks chose the Provost Brand for their
Abbot because he was a very good man, and very
wise; and they sent him to Edgar Ætheling, for
the people of those parts supposed that he should
be the King; and the Ætheling willingly confirmed
him in his office. When King William
heard this he was very wroth, and said that the
Abbot had treated him with contempt; but good
men interfered and reconciled them, because of
the excellence of the Abbot. He gave the King
forty marks of gold for his favour, and he lived
but a short time after, only three years. After
this all tribulation and evil came upon the monastery.
May God have pity on it. And this
year Christ Church was burned, and a comet
appeared on the 14th of the calends of May.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p class="center">1067.</p>

<p>This year the King went over sea, and took
with him hostages and treasures. And he came
back the next year on St. Nicholas’ day; and on
his return he restored to every man his land.—And
this summer Childe Edgar and Mærleswegn,
and many others with them, departed and went
to Scotland, and King Malcolm received them
all, and took the Childe’s sister Margaret for
his wife.</p>


<p class="center">1068.</p>

<p>This year King William gave the Earldom of
Northumberland to Earl Robert, and the men of
that country came against him, and slew him and
900 others with him. And then Edgar Ætheling
marched with all the Northumbrians to York,
and the townsmen treated with him; on which
King William came from the south with all his
troops, and sacked the town, and slew many
hundred persons: and the Ætheling went again
to Scotland.</p>


<p class="center">1069.</p>

<p>This year Bishop Ægelric, being at Peterborough,
was accused and sent to Westminster;
and his brother Bishop Ægelwin was outlawed.
Then between the two feasts of St. Mary, the
sons of King Swegn and his brother Earl Osbearn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>came from Denmark with three hundred
ships; on which Earl Waltheof marched forth,
and he and Edgar Ætheling, and many hundreds
with them, came and joined this fleet in the
Humber, and they proceeded to York, and they
landed and stormed the castle, and slew many
hundred men, and carried much treasure to their
ships: and they kept the chief men in bonds;
and they wintered between the Ouse and the
Trent. And King William went into those parts,
and laid them all waste. And the same year
Brand Abbot of Peterborough died on the 5th
of the calends of December.</p>


<p class="center">1070.</p>

<p>This year Landfranc Abbot of Caen came to
England, and in a few days he was made Archbishop
of Canterbury. He was consecrated at
his metropolis on the 4th of the calends of September,
by eight Bishops his suffragans; the rest
who were absent signifying through messengers,
and by writing, why they could not be there.—This
year Thomas, who had been chosen as
Bishop of York, came to Canterbury, that he
might be consecrated there after the old form,
but when Landfranc craved the confirmation of
his subjection by oath, he refused, and said that
he was not obliged to give it. Then was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>Archbishop Landfranc wroth, and he commanded
the Bishops, who were there at his behest to
assist at the ceremony, and all the monks, to unrobe
him; and they did as he desired: so this
time Thomas returned home without a blessing.
It happened soon after this, that the Archbishop
Landfranc went to Rome, and Thomas with him:
and when they were come thither, and had said
all that they would on other subjects, Thomas
began his speech, saying how he had come to
Canterbury, and how the Archbishop had desired
of him an oath of obedience, and that he
had refused it. Then the Archbishop Landfranc
began to make manifest with clear reasoning, that
he had a right to demand that which he required;
and he proved the same with strong arguments
before the Pope Alexander, and before all the
council then assembled: and thus they departed
home. After this, Thomas came to Canterbury,
and humbly performed all that the Archbishop
required, and thereupon he received the blessing.
This year Earl Waltheof made peace with the
King. And during this Lent the King caused
all the monasteries in England to be despoiled of
their treasures. The same year King Swegn
came from Denmark into the Humber, and the
people of those parts came to meet him and made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>an alliance with him, for they believed that he
would conquer this land. Then the Danish
Bishop Christien, and Earl Osbearn, and their
Danish retainers, came into Ely, and all the
people of the fens joined them, for they believed
that they would conquer the whole country.—Now
the monks of Peterborough were told that
some of their own men, these were Hereward
and his train, would pillage the monastery, and
this, because they had heard that the King had
given the Abbacy to a French Abbot named
Turold, and that he was a very stern man, and
that he was come into Stamford with all his French
followers. There was, at that time, a church-warden
named Ywar; and he took all that he could
by night, gospels, mass-robes, cassocks, and other
garments, even all and each of such small things
as he could carry away, and he came before day
to the Abbot Turold, and told him that he sought
his protection, and told how the outlaws were
coming to Peterborough, and he said that he
had done this at the desire of the monks. Then
early in the morning all the outlaws came with
many ships, and they endeavoured to enter the
monastery, but the monks withstood them, so
that they were not able to get in. Then they
set fire to it, and burned all the monks’ houses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>and all those in the town, save one: and they
broke in through the fire at Bolhithe-geate (the
Bulldyke gate), and the monks came before them
and desired peace. But they gave no heed to
them, and they went into the monastery, and
climbed up to the holy crucifix, and took the
crown from our Lord’s head, which was all of
the purest gold, and they took the footstool of
red gold from under his feet. And they climbed
up to the steeple, and brought down the cope
which was hidden there; it was all of gold and
silver. They also seized two gilt shrines, and
nine of silver, and they carried off fifteen great
crosses of gold and silver. And they took so
much gold and silver, and so much treasure in
money, robes, and books, that no man can compute
the amount; saying they did this because
of their allegiance to the monastery: and afterwards
they betook themselves to their ships and
went to Ely, and there they secured their treasures.
The Danes believed that they should
overcome the Frenchmen, and they drove away
all the monks, leaving only one named Leofwin
the Long, and he lay sick in the hospital. Then
came the Abbot Turold, and eight score Frenchmen
with him, all well armed; and when he arrived
he found all burnt both within and without, excepting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>the church itself; and all the outlaws
were then embarked, knowing that he would
come thither. This happened on the 4th of the
nones of June. Then the two Kings, William
and Swegn, made peace with each other, on
which the Danes departed from Ely, carrying
with them all the aforesaid treasure. When they
were come into the midst of the sea, there arose
a great storm, which dispersed all the ships in
which the treasures were: some were driven to
Norway, some to Ireland, and others to Denmark,
and all the spoil that reached the latter
country, being the cope and some of the shrines
and crosses, and many of the other treasures,
they brought to one of the King’s towns called
——, and laid it all up in the church.—But
one night, through their carelessness and
drunkenness the church was burned, with all
that was in it. Thus was the monastery of Peterborough
burned and pillaged. May Almighty
God have pity on it in his great mercy: and
thus the Abbot Turold came to Peterborough,
and the monks returned thither and performed
christian worship in the church, which had stood
a full week without service of any kind. When
Bishop Ægelric heard this, he excommunicated
all the men who had done this evil. There was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>a great famine this year; and this summer the
fleet from the Humber sailed into the Thames,
and lay there two nights, and it afterwards held
on its course to Denmark. And Earl Baldwin
died, and his son Arnulf succeeded him; and
Earl William (Fitz Osbern) and the French
King should have been his support: but Earl
Robert came and slew his kinsman Arnulf, and
the Earl; and put the King to flight, and slew
many thousands of his men.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“In the second year after Lanfranc’s consecration
he went to Rome. Pope Alexander so
greatly honoured him, that contrary to his custom
he rose to meet him, and gave him two palls in
token of especial favour: Lanfranc received one
of them from the altar after the Roman manner,
and the Pope, with his own hands, gave him the
other, in which he himself had been accustomed
to perform mass. In the presence of the Pope,
Thomas brought forwards a calumny touching
the primacy of the see of Canterbury, and the
subjection of certain Bishops. Lanfranc briefly
and clearly states the conclusion to which this
affair was afterwards brought in England, in an
epistle to the aforesaid Pope Alexander. This
year a general council was held at Winchester,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>in which he deposed Wulfric Abbot of the new
monastery, and made many regulations touching
Christian discipline. A few days afterwards, he
consecrated Osbern at London as Bishop of
Exeter, and Scotland at Canterbury as Abbot of
St. Augustine’s.</p>

<p>“In his 3d year he consecrated Peter at Gloucester
as Bishop of Litchfield or Chester. This
year also a great council was held at a place
called Pinenden (Pinnenden or Pinchenden Heath,
near Maidstone), in which Lanfranc proved that
he and his church held their lands and their
rights by sea and by land, as freely as the King
held his: excepting in three cases: to wit, if the
highway be dug up; if a tree be cut so as to fall
upon it; and if murder be committed and blood
spilt: when a man is taken in these misdeeds, the
fine paid shall belong to the King; otherwise
their vassals shall be free from regal exactions.</p>

<p>“In his 4th year he consecrated Patrick at
London as Bishop of Dublin, in Ireland, from
whom he received a profession of obedience, and
he moreover gave him very memorable letters to
the Kings of Ireland.</p>

<p>“In his 5th year a general council was held at
London, the proceedings of which Lanfranc
committed to writing, at the request of many.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>
<p>“In his 6th year he gave the bishoprick of
Rochester to Hernost, a monk of Christ Church,
whom he also consecrated at London. A council
was held at Winchester: and the same year Hernost
departed this life.</p>

<p>“In his 7th year, he gave the bishoprick of
Rochester to Gundulf, whom he consecrated at
Canterbury. This year Thomas Archbishop of
York sent letters to Lanfranc, requesting that he
would send two Bishops to consecrate a certain
priest, who had come to him with letters from the
Orkneys, to the intent that he might be made
Bishop of those islands. Lanfranc consenting to
this, commanded Wolstan Bishop of Worcester,
and Peter Bishop of Chester, to go to York, and
to assist Thomas in completing the ceremony.</p>

<p>“In his 8th year, a council was held at London,
in which Lanfranc deposed Ailnod Abbot of
Glastonbury.</p>

<p>“In his 11th year, a council was held at Gloucester,
wherein, by the King’s order, and with
the consent of Lanfranc, Thomas Archbishop of
York consecrated William to the Bishoprick of
Durham; and because he could not be attended
by the Scotch Bishops his suffragans, the Bishops
Wolstan, Osbern, Giso, and Robert assisted at
this ceremony by the command of Lanfranc.—At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>this time Lanfranc sent letters rich in sacred
lore to Bishop Donald in Ireland.</p>

<p>“In his 16th year Lanfranc consecrated Donatus,
his monk at Canterbury, to the bishoprick
of Dublin, by the desire of the King, clergy,
and people of Ireland. This year a council was
held at Gloucester, wherein Lanfranc deposed
Wulstcetel Abbot of Croyland. He consecrated
Robert to the bishoprick of Chester, and William
to that of Elmham, in one day, at Canterbury.
At Winchester also he consecrated Maurice
as Bishop of London, who brought noble
gifts to his mother church of Canterbury a few
days afterwards.</p>

<p>“In the 18th year of Lanfranc’s prelacy, on
the death of King William beyond sea, he acknowledged
his son William, as he had done his
father, and consecrated and crowned him in St.
Peter’s Church, which is in the western part of
London. The same year, and at his metropolitan
city of Canterbury, he examined and consecrated
Godfrey as Bishop of Chichester, Wido
also as Abbot of St. Augustine’s and John as
Bishop of Wells. The next day Lanfranc, on
his own authority, and taking with him Odo
Bishop of Baieux the King’s brother, who was
then at Canterbury, conducted the Abbot Wido
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>to St. Augustine’s and commanded the Brothers
of the Order to receive him as their own Abbot
and Pastor; but they, with one accord, answered
that they would neither submit to him nor receive
him. Thus Lanfranc came leading the Abbot,
and when he found that the Monks were obstinate
in resistance, and that they would not obey him,
he commanded that all the refractory should
come out one by one. When therefore nearly
all had left the monastery, Lanfranc and his suite
led in the Abbot with much pomp, placed him in
the chair, and delivered the church up to him.
He also seized the Prior, Elfrin by name, and as
many others as he thought fit, and he put them
forthwith into claustral imprisonment at Canterbury;
but he sent those who had the greatest
influence, and were the authors of this scandal,
to the castle to be confined there. After he had
returned home having finished all, he was informed
that the monks who had left the monastery
were assembled, near St. Mildred’s church.
Hereupon he sent to them, saying, that if they
would, they might return to the church before
the 9th hour, but that if they delayed longer,
they would not be allowed free entrance, but be
treated as renegadoes. Having heard this message
they doubted whether to return or to remain, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>at the hour of refection, when they became anhungered,
many repenting of their obstinacy sent
to Lanfranc and promised submission. These he
treated with lenity, and desired that they should
return directly and confirm by oath their profession
of obedience to the aforesaid Abbot. Thus
they returned and swore faithfulness and obedience
to the Abbot Wido, upon the relics of St.
Augustine. Lanfranc seized those who remained
behind and placed them in various monasteries
of England, confining them till he
brought them to profess their submission. About
the same time he seized one of them named
Ælfred, who had attempted to flee, and confined
him loaded with irons at Canterbury, together
with some of his fellows: and he exercised
upon them the utmost severity of their
order. But when these monks were thought to
be sufficiently humbled and had promised amendment,
Lanfranc taking pity on them, had them
brought from the several places whither he had
banished them, and reconciled them to their
Abbot.</p>

<p>“The same year the dissentions were renewed,
and the monks plotted the death of their Abbot,
but one of them, named Columban, being taken,
Lanfranc caused him to be brought to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>And as he stood there before him, Lanfranc
asked if he desired to murder his Abbot. And
the monk forthwith replied “Yes! if I could
I would certainly kill him.” Then Lanfranc
commanded that he should be tied up naked by
the gates of St. Augustine’s and suffer flagellation
before all the people, that his cowl should
then be torn off, and that he should be driven out
of the city. This order was executed, and
thenceforth during Lanfranc’s life, sedition was
repressed by the dread of his severity.</p>

<p>“In the 19th year of his prelacy, died the
venerable Archbishop Lanfranc, and he was
buried at his metropolitan see of Canterbury, of
which he had been possessed eighteen years, nine
months, and two days. His deeds, his buildings,
alms, and labours, are only in part recounted in
the writing which is read on his anniversary,
for they were very numerous. After his death
the monks of St. Augustine’s, openly rebelling
against their aforesaid Abbot Wido, stirred up the
citizens of Canterbury, who, with an armed
force, attempted to slay him in his house. But
his family made resistance, and when many had
been wounded, and some killed on both sides,
the Abbot with much difficulty escaped unhurt
from amongst them, and fled for refuge to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>mother church of Canterbury (Christ Church).
On the report of this disturbance Walkelm
Bishop of Winchester, and Gundulf Bishop of
Rochester, suffragans to the see of Canterbury,
with some noblemen sent by the King, hastened
to Canterbury, that they might take vengeance
on the delinquents; and when they had enquired
into the causes of the sedition and had found
the monks unable to clear themselves, they condemned
them to suffer public punishment because
they had transgressed openly. But the
prior and monks of Christ Church, moved with
piety, pleaded against this sentence, lest, if they
were to receive their discipline before all the
people, they should henceforth be accounted infamous,
and so their profession and office come to
be despised. Wherefore it was granted on their
intercession, that the punishment should take
place in the church, into which the populace
should not be admitted, but those only who
were appointed to see it executed. And two
monks of Christ Church, Wido and Norman,
were called in, and they inflicted the punishment
at the command of the Bishops. Then
the rebellious monks were dispersed into various
monasteries of England; and 24 monks of
Christ Church were substituted in their place,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>together with the prior, named Anthony, who
had been sub-prior at Christ Church. The
townsmen who entered the Abbot’s hall in arms
were seized, and those who were convicted of
having struck him lost their eyes.</p>

<p>“After the death of Lanfranc the see remained
vacant four years, nine months, and nine days,
during which time it suffered much adversity.
At length, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation
1093 and on the 2d of the nones of March, the
Archbishoprick of Canterbury was given to Anselm
Abbot of Bec, a good and an upright man,
of great learning, and amongst the most noted
of his time. He came to Canterbury on the 7th
of the calends of October, his earlier arrival
having been prevented by many sufficient causes,
and he was consecrated on the 2d of the nones of
December.”</p>


<p class="center">1071.</p>

<p>This year Earl Ædwin and Earl Morker withdrew
themselves and wandered through the woods
and fields. Then Earl Morker took ship and
went to Ely; and Earl Ædwin was slain
treacherously by his own men: and Bishop Egelwin,
and Siward Bearn, and many hundreds
with them, came into Ely. And when King
William heard this, he called out a fleet and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>army; and he surrounded that land, and he made
a bridge and entered in, his fleet lying off the
coast. Then all the outlaws surrendered; these
were, Bishop Egelwin and Earl Morker, and all
who were with them, excepting only Hereward,
and his followers whom he led off with great
valour. And the King seized their ships, and
arms, and much treasure; and he disposed of the
men as he would; and he sent Bishop Egelwin
to Abingdon, where he died early in the winter.</p>


<p class="center">1072.</p>

<p>This year King William led an army and a
fleet against Scotland, and he stationed the ships
along the coast and crossed the Tweed with his
army; but he found nothing to reward his pains.
And King Malcolm came and treated with King
William, and delivered hostages, and became
his liege-man; and King William returned home
with his forces. And Bishop Egelric died; he
had been consecrated to the Archbishoprick of
York, of which he was unjustly deprived, and
the see of Durham was given to him; this he held
as long as he would, and then resigned it and
went to the monastery of Peterborough, and there
he spent 12 years. Then after King William had
conquered England, he removed Egelric from
Peterborough, and sent him to Westminster, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>he died on the ides of October, and he is buried
in the Abbey, in the aisle of St. Nicholas.</p>


<p class="center">1073.</p>

<p>This year King William carried an army of
English and French over sea, and conquered the
province of Maine: and the English did great
damage, for they destroyed the vineyards and
burned the towns, and they laid waste that province,
the whole of which submitted to William;
and they afterwards returned home again.</p>


<p class="center">1074.</p>

<p>This year King William went over sea to Normandy;
and Childe Edgar came thither from
Scotland, and the King received him and all his
men into the protection of the law, and he remained
at Court, enjoying such privileges as the
King granted him.</p>


<p class="center">1075.</p>

<p>This year King William gave the daughter
of William Osbearn’s son in marriage to Earl
Ralph: the said Ralph was a Welchman on his
mother’s side, and his father was an Englishman
named Ralph, who was born in Norfolk. Then
the King gave the Earldom of Norfolk and Suffolk
to his son, who brought his wife to Norwich,
but there the bridal feast was the bane of all: for
Earl Roger and Earl Waltheof were there, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>Bishops and Abbots, and they took counsel to
depose the King of England. And this was
soon reported to the King then in Normandy,
and it was told him withal that Earl Roger and
Earl Ralph were the heads of the conspiracy,
and that they had brought over the Welch to
their side, and had sent eastward to Denmark
for a fleet to assist them. And Earl Roger departed
to his earldom in the west, and gathered
his people together in rebellion against the King,
but he was checked in his attempt. And Earl
Ralph also being in his earldom would have
marched forth with his people; but the garrisons
of the castles of England, and the inhabitants of
the country came against him, and prevented his
effecting any thing, on which he took ship at
Norwich: and his wife remained in the castle,
and held it till she had obtained terms, and then
she departed from England with all her adherents.
And after this the King came to England,
and he took his kinsman Earl Roger and
put him in prison; he also seized Earl Waltheof.
And soon afterwards 200 ships arrived from Denmark,
commanded by two chieftains, Cnut the
son of Swegn, and Earl Hacon, but they durst
not risk a battle with King William, and they
bore away for Flanders. And the lady Eadgith
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>died at Winchester seven nights before Christmas,
and the King caused her to be brought to
Westminster with great pomp, and to be laid by
her Lord King Edward. And the King was
at Westminster during Christmas, and there all
the Welchmen who had been at the bridal feast
at Norwich were brought to justice; some were
blinded, and others banished. Thus were put
down the traitors to William.</p>


<p class="center">1076.</p>

<p>This year Swægn King of Denmark died, and
Harold his son succeeded to the kingdom. And
the King gave Westminster to Vithele, who had
before been Abbot of Bernay. Earl Waltheof
was beheaded at Winchester, and his body was
carried to Croyland. And the King went over
sea and led his army into Britanny, and besieged
the castle of Dol, and the Bretons defended it
till the King of France came up, and then William
departed, having lost both men and horses
and much treasure.</p>


<p class="center">1077.</p>

<p>This year a peace was made between the King
of France and William King of England, and
it lasted but a little while. And this year, one
night before the Assumption of St. Mary, there
was a more dreadful fire in London than had
ever happened since the town was built. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>this year Ægelwig Abbot of Evesham died on the
14th of the calends of March. Bishop Hereman
died also on the 10th of the calends of March.</p>


<p class="center">1079.</p>

<p>This year, between the two feasts of St. Mary,
King Malcolm invaded England with a large
army, and laid waste Northumberland as far as
the Tyne; and he slew many hundred men, and
carried home much money and treasure and
many prisoners. And the same year King William
fought against his son Robert without the
borders of Normandy near a castle called Gerborneth
(Gerberoy), and there King William
was wounded, and the horse on which he sat was
killed, and his son William was also wounded,
and many men were slain.</p>


<p class="center">1080.</p>

<p>This year Walcher Bishop of Durham was
slain at a gemot, and a hundred French and
Flemings with him: Walcher himself was born
in Lorrain. The Northumbrians perpetrated
this in the month of May.</p>


<p class="center">1081.</p>

<p>This year the King led an army into Wales,
and there he set free many hundred persons.</p>


<p class="center">1082.</p>

<p>This year the King arrested Bishop Odo.
And there was a great famine this year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p class="center">1083.</p>

<p>This year a quarrel arose in Glastonbury between
the Abbot Thurstan and his monks. It
was first caused by the Abbot’s unwise conduct,
in that he treated his monks ill in many respects,
but the monks were lovingly-minded towards
him, and begged him to govern them in right
and in kindness, and they would be faithful and
obedient to him. But the Abbot would none of
this, and wrought them evil, and threatened worse.
One day the Abbot went into the Chapter-house,
and harangued the monks, and would have
taught them amiss;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[BH]</a> and he sent for laymen, and
they came in all armed upon the monks in the
Chapter-house. Then the monks were greatly
terrified and knew not what to do, and some ran
for refuge into the church and locked the doors
from within; but the others followed them, and
would have dragged them forth when they durst
not come out. Rueful things happened there on
that day, for the French broke into the choir and
threw darts towards the altar where the monks
were collected, and some of their servants went
upon the upper floor and shot down arrows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>towards the chancel, so that many arrows stuck
in the crucifix which stood above the altar, and
the wretched monks lay around the altar, and
some crept under it, and they called earnestly
upon God and besought his mercy, since they
could obtain no mercy at the hands of men.
What can we say, but that they shot without
ceasing, and others broke down the doors, and
rushed in, and they slew some of the monks and
wounded many, so that the blood ran down from
the altar on the steps, and from the steps to the
floor. Three were smitten to death and eighteen
wounded. And the same year Matilda the wife
of King William died on the day after the feast
of All Saints. And the same year after Christmas
the King caused a great and heavy tax to be
raised throughout England, even 72 pence upon
every hide of land.</p>


<p class="center">1084.</p>

<p>This year Wulfwold Abbot of Chertsey died
on the 13th of the calends of May.</p>


<p class="center">1085.</p>

<p>This year men said and reported as certain,
that Cnut King of Denmark, the son of King
Swægn was bent hitherward, and that he designed
to conquer this land, with the assistance
of Robert Earl of Flanders, whose daughter he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>had married. When King William, who was
then in Normandy, heard this, for England and
Normandy were both his, he hastened hither with
a larger army of horse and foot, from France
and Britanny, than had ever arrived in this land,
so that men wondered how the country might
feed them all. But the King billetted the soldiers
upon his subjects throughout the nation,
and they provided for them, every man according
to the land that he possessed. And the
people suffered much distress this year: and
the King caused the country near the sea to
be laid waste, that if his enemies landed they
might the less readily find any plunder. Afterwards
when he had received certain information
that they had been stopped, and that they would
not be able to proceed in this enterprise, he
let part of his forces return to their own
homes, and he kept part in this land through
the winter. At Christmas the King was at Gloucester
with his Witan; and he held his court
there five days; and afterwards the Archbishop
and Clergy held a synod during three days; and
Maurice was there chosen to the bishoprick of
London, William to that of Norfolk, and Robert,
to that of Cheshire; they were all chaplains of
the King. After this the King had a great consultation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>and spoke very deeply with his Witan
concerning this land, how it was held and what
were its tenantry. He then sent his men over all
England, into every shire, and caused them to ascertain
how many hundred hides of land it contained,
and what lands the King possessed therein,
what cattle there were in the several counties, and
how much revenue he ought to receive yearly
from each. He also caused them to write down
how much land belonged to his Archbishops, to his
Bishops, his Abbots, and his Earls, and, that I may
be brief, what property every inhabitant of all
England possessed in land or in cattle, and how
much money this was worth. So very narrowly
did he cause the survey to be made, that there
was not a single hide nor a rood of land, nor—it
is shameful to relate that which he thought no
shame to do—was there an ox, or a cow, or a
pig passed by, and that was not set down in the
accounts, and then all these writings were brought
to him.</p>


<p class="center">1086.</p>

<p>This year the King wore his crown and held
his court at Winchester at Easter, and he so
journeyed forward that he was at Westminster
during Pentecost, and there he dubbed his son
Henry a knight. And afterwards he travelled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>about, so that he came to Salisbury at Lammas;
and his Witan, and all the land-holders of substance
in England, whose vassals soever they
were, repaired to him there, and they all submitted
to him, and became his men, and swore
oaths of allegiance, that they would be faithful
to him against all others. Thence he proceeded
to Wight because he was to cross over to Normandy;
and this he afterwards did, but first,
according to his custom, he extorted immense
sums from his subjects, upon every pretext he
could find, whether just or otherwise. Then he
went over to Normandy, and King Edward’s
kinsman Edgar Ætheling left him, because he
received no great honour from him: may Almighty
God give him glory hereafter. And the
Ætheling’s sister Cristina went into the monastery of
Romsey, and took the holy veil. And
the same was a very heavy year, and very disastrous
and sorrowful; for there was a pestilence
among the cattle, and the corn and fruits were
checked; and the weather was worse than may
easily be conceived: so violent was the thunder
and lightning, that many persons were killed:
and things ever went worse and worse with the
people: may Almighty God mend them, when
such is his will.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p class="center">1087.</p>

<p>The year 1087 after the birth of Christ our
Saviour, and the one and twentieth of King William’s
reign, during which he governed and disposed
of the realm of England even as God permitted
him, was a very grievous time of scarcity
in this land. There was also so much illness,
that almost every other man was afflicted with
the worst of evils, that is, a fever; and this so
severe, that many died of it. And afterwards,
from the badness of the weather which we have
mentioned before, there was so great a famine
throughout England, that many hundreds died
of hunger. O how disastrous, how rueful were
those times! when the wretched people were
brought to the point of death by the fever, then
the cruel famine came on and finished them.—Who
would not deplore such times, or who is
so hard hearted that he will not weep for so much
misery? But such things are, on account of the
sins of the people, and because they will not
love God and righteousness. Even so was it in
those days; there was little righteousness in this
land amongst any, excepting the monks alone
who lived piously. The King and the chief
men loved much, and over much, to amass gold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>and silver, and cared not how sinfully it was
gotten, so that it came into their hands. The
King sold out his lands as dear as dearest he
might, and then some other man came and bid
more than the first had given, and the King
granted them to him who offered the larger sum;
then came a third and bid yet more, and the
King made over the lands to him who offered
most of all; and he cared not how iniquitously
his Sheriffs extorted money from the miserable
people, nor how many unlawful things they did.
And the more men spake of rightful laws, the
more lawlessly did they act. They raised oppressive
taxes, and so many were their unjust
deeds, it were hard to number them. And the same
year, before harvest, St. Paul’s holy minster, the
residence of the Bishops of London, was burnt,
together with many other monasteries, and the
greater and handsomer part of the whole city.
At the same time likewise almost all the principal
towns of England were burnt down. O how
sad and deplorable was this year, which brought
forth so many calamities.</p>

<p>The same year also, before the Assumption of
St. Mary, King William marched with an army
out of Normandy into France, and made war upon
his own Lord King Philip, and slew a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>number of his people, and burned the town of
Mante, and all the holy monasteries in it, and
two holy men who served God as anchorites were
burned there. This done King William returned
into Normandy. Rueful deeds he did,
and ruefully he suffered. Wherefore ruefully?
He fell sick and became grievously ill. What
can I say? The sharpness of death, that spareth
neither rich nor poor, seized upon him. He
died in Normandy the day after the Nativity of
St. Mary, and he was buried in Caen, at St.
Stephen’s monastery, which he had built and
had richly endowed. O how false, how unstable
is the good of this world, He, who had been a
powerful King and Lord of many territories,
He, then, of all his lands, possessed not
more than seven feet of ground; and He,
who was erewhile adorned with gold and with
gems, lay then covered with mould. He left
three sons: Robert the eldest was Earl of Normandy
after him; the second, named William
wore the crown of England after his father’s
death; and his third son was Henry, to whom he
bequeathed immense treasures.</p>

<p>If any would know what manner of man King
William was, the glory that he obtained, and of
how many lands he was Lord; then will we describe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>him as we have known him, we, who have
looked upon him, and who once lived in his
court. This King William, of whom we are
speaking, was a very wise and a great man, and
more honoured and more powerful than any
of his predecessors. He was mild to those good
men who loved God, but severe beyond measure
towards those who withstood his will. He
founded a noble monastery on the spot where
God permitted him to conquer England, and he
established monks in it, and he made it very rich.
In his days the great monastery at Canterbury
was built, and many others also throughout England;
moreover this land was filled with monks
who lived after the rule of St. Benedict; and
such was the state of religion in his days that
all that would, might observe that which was
prescribed by their respective orders. King
William was also held in much reverence; he
wore his crown three times every year when he
was in England: at Easter he wore it at Winchester,
at Pentecost at Westminster, and at
Christmas at Gloucester. And at these times,
all the men of England were with him, Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, and Earls, Thanes,
and Knights. So also, was he a very stern and
a wrathful man, so that none durst do any thing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>against his will, and he kept in prison those
Earls who acted against his pleasure. He removed
Bishops from their sees, and Abbots from
their offices, and he imprisoned Thanes, and
at length he spared not his own brother Odo.
This Odo was a very powerful Bishop in Normandy,
his see was that of Baieux, and he was
foremost to serve the King. He had an Earldom
in England, and when William was in Normandy
he was the first man in this country, and
him did he cast into prison. Amongst other
things the good order that William established is
not to be forgotten; it was such that any man,
who was himself aught, might travel over
the kingdom with a bosom-full of gold unmolested;
and no man durst kill another, however
great the injury he might have received from
him. He reigned over England, and being sharp-sighted
to his own interest, he surveyed the kingdom
so thoroughly that there was not a single hide
of land throughout the whole, of which he knew
not the possession, and how much it was worth,
and this he afterwards entered in his register.
The land of the Britons (Wales) was under his
sway, and he built castles therein; moreover
he had full dominion over the Isle of Mann
(Anglesey): Scotland also was subject to him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>from his great strength; the land of Normandy
was his by inheritance, and he possessed the
Earldom of Maine; and had he lived two years
longer he would have subdued Ireland by his
prowess, and that without a battle. Truly there
was much trouble in these times, and very
great distress; he caused castles to be built,
and oppressed the poor. The King was also
of great sternness, and he took from his subjects
many marks of gold, and many hundred
pounds of silver, and this, either with or without
right, and with little need. He was given
to avarice and greedily loved gain. He made
large forests for the deer, and enacted laws
therewith, so that whoever killed a hart or a
hind should be blinded. As he forbade killing
the deer, so also the boars; and he loved the tall
stags as if he were their father. He also appointed
concerning the hares, that they should
go free. The rich complained and the poor
murmured, but he was so sturdy that he recked
nought of them; they must will all that the
King willed, if they would live; or would keep
their lands; or would hold their possessions;
or would be maintained in their rights. Alas!
that any man should so exalt himself, and carry
himself in his pride over all! May Almighty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>God shew mercy to his soul, and grant him
the forgiveness of his sins! We have written
concerning him these things, both good and
bad, that virtuous men might follow after the
good, and wholly avoid the evil, and might go
in the way that leadeth to the kingdom of
heaven.</p>

<p>We may write of many events which happened
during this year. In Denmark, the Danes
who were formerly accounted the most loyal of
people, turned to the greatest possible perfidy
and treachery, for they chose King Cnut, and
submitted to him, and swore oaths of allegiance
and afterwards they shamefully murdered him in
a church.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[BI]</a> It also came to pass in Spain, that
the heathen men went forth, and made war upon
the Christians, and brought great part of the
country into subjection to themselves. But the
Christian King, whose name was Anphos (Alfonso),
sent to all countries and begged assistance.
And allies flocked to him from every
Christian land, and they went forth, and slew or
drove away all the heathens, and they won their
land again by the help of God. The same year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>also many great men died in this land: Stigand
Bishop of Chichester, and the Abbot of Saint
Augustine’s, and the Abbots of Bath and of Pershore,
and the Lord of them all William King
of England, concerning whom we have spoken
above.</p>

<p>After his death, his son William, of the same
name with his father, took to himself the government,
and was consecrated as King in Westminster
by Archbishop Lanfranc three days before
Michaelmas: and all the men of England
acknowledged him, and swore oaths of allegiance
to him. This done, the King went to Winchester
and examined the treasury, and the
hoards which his father had amassed; gold and
silver, vessels of plate, palls, gems, and many
other valuables that are hard to be numbered:—The
King did as his father before he died commanded
him; he distributed treasures amongst
all the monasteries of England, for the sake of
his father’s soul: to some he gave ten marks of
gold, and to others six, and sixty pennies to
every country church, and a hundred pounds of
money was sent into every county to be divided
among the poor for his soul’s sake. And before
he died he had also desired that all who had
been imprisoned during his reign should be released.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>And the King was at London during
Christmas.</p>


<p class="center">1088.</p>

<p>This year the land was much disturbed, and
filled with treason, for the principal Frenchmen
here would have betrayed their Lord the King,
and have had his brother Robert instead, who
was Earl of Normandy. Bishop Odo was the
chief man in the conspiracy, together with Bishop
Gosfrith, and William Bishop of Durham.—The
King esteemed the Bishop so highly, that
the affairs of all England were directed after his
counsel, and according to his pleasure, but the
Bishop purposed to do by him as Judas Iscariot
did by our Lord. And Earl Roger was concerned
in this conspiracy, and many others with
him, all Frenchmen. This plot was concerted
during Lent; and as soon as Easter came, they
marched forth, and plundered, and burned, and
laid waste the lands of the crown; and they
ruined the estates of those who remained firm in
their allegiance. And each of the head conspirators
went to his own castle, and manned and
victualled it, as best he might. Bishop Gosfrith
and Robert the Peace-breaker went to Bristol,
and having plundered the town, they brought
the spoils into the castle; and afterwards they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>sallied forth and plundered Bath, and all the surrounding
country, and they laid waste all the lordship
of Berkeley. And the chief men of Hereford
and all that county, and the men of Shropshire,
with many from Wales, entered Worcestershire,
and went on plundering and burning,
till they approached the county town, and they
were resolved to burn this also, and to plunder
the cathedral, and to seize the King’s castle for
themselves. The worthy Bishop Wulfstan seeing
this, was much distressed in mind, because
the castle was committed to his keeping. Nevertheless
his retainers, few as they were, marched
out, and through the mercy of God, and the
good desert of the Bishop, they slew or took
captive 500 men, and put all the rest to flight.—The
Bishop of Durham did as much harm
as he could in all the northern parts: one of
the conspirators named Roger, threw himself
into Norwich castle, and spread devastation
throughout that country: Hugo also was in no
respect less formidable to Leicestershire and
Northampton. Bishop Odo, with whom these
commotions originated, departed to his Earldom
of Kent, which he ravaged, and he wholly laid
waste the lands of the King and the Archbishop,
and brought all the plunder into his castle at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>Rochester. When the King had heard all this,
and with what treason they were acting towards
him, he was greatly disturbed in mind; and he
sent for the English, and laid his necessities before
them, and entreated their assistance. He
promised them better laws than had ever been in
this land, and forbade all unjust taxes, and
guaranteed to his subjects their woods and hunting.
But these concessions were soon done
away. Howbeit the English came to the aid of
their Lord the King, and they then marched towards
Rochester desiring to seize Bishop Odo,
for they thought that if they had him who was
the head of the conspiracy in their power, they
might with greater ease subdue the others.—Then
they came to Tunbridge castle, in which
were the Knights of Bishop Odo and many
others, resolved to hold out against William.
But the English came on, and stormed the
castle, and the garrison capitulated. They then
proceeded towards Rochester believing that the
Bishop was there; but the King was told that he
was departed to his castle at Pevensey, and the
King and his troops went after him, and he besieged
that castle full six weeks with a very large
army. In the mean time Robert Earl of Normandy,
the King’s brother, gathered together a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>great multitude, and thought that he should win
England with the aid of the disaffected of this
country. And he sent some of his troops to this
land, intending to follow them himself. But
the English who guarded the sea attacked these
men, and slew and drowned more than any one
can number. At length provisions became scarce
in the castle, on which the insurgents prayed for
a truce and surrendered the place to the King,
and the Bishop took an oath that he would depart
from England, and never return unless the
King sent for him, and that he would also give
up Rochester castle. After this the Bishop proceeded
thither that he might deliver up that fortress,
and the King sent his men with him, but
then the soldiers who were in the castle arose,
and seized the Bishop, and the King’s men, whom
they put into confinement. There were very
good knights in this castle: Eustace the younger,
the three sons of Earl Roger, and all the best
born of this land, and of Normandy. When
the King knew this, he set forth with all the
troops then with him, and he sent over all England
and commanded that every man of mark,
French or English, from town and from country,
should come and join him. Many were those
who flocked to him and he marched to Rochester
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>and besieged the castle till the garrison capitulated.
Bishop Odo and those who were with
him departed over sea, and thus the Bishop
lost the station he held in this land. The
King afterwards sent an army to Durham, and
besieged the castle, and the Bishop capitulated,
and surrendered it, and he gave up his Bishoprick
and went to Normandy. Many Frenchmen
also left their lands, and went over sea, and the
King gave their estates to those who had held
fast to him.</p>


<p class="center">1089.</p>

<p>This year the venerable father and patron of
monks Archbishop Lanfranc departed this life,
but we trust that he hath entered into the kingdom
of heaven. There was also a great earthquake
throughout England on the 3d of the ides
of August. And it was a very late year both as
to the corn, and fruits of all kind, so that many
men reaped their corn about Martinmas, and
even later.</p>


<p class="center">1090.</p>

<p>Things being in the state we have described,
as regarding the King, his brother, and his
people, William considered how he might take
the surest vengeance on his wretched brother
Robert, and win Normandy from him. To this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>end, he gained the castle and port of St. Valeri by
stratagem or bribery, and also Albemarle Castle,
and he placed his knights in them, and they did
much harm, ravaging and burning the country.
After this he got possession of more castles in
that land, and in these also he stationed his
knights. When Robert Earl of Normandy found
that his sworn liege-men revolted and gave up
their castles to his great injury, he sent to his
Lord Philip King of France, who came into
Normandy with a large army; and the King and
the Earl with an innumerable force besieged a castle
defended by the King of England’s soldiers: but
King William of England sent to Philip King
of France, and he, for love of William or for
his great bribes, deserted his vassal Earl Robert
and his land, and returned to France, leaving
things as they were. During all these transactions,
England was greatly oppressed by unlawful
taxes, and many other grievances.</p>


<p class="center">1091.</p>

<p>This year King William held his court at
Westminster at Christmas, and the following
Candlemas he departed from England to Normandy,
bent on his brother’s ruin: but whilst he
was in that country, peace was made between
them, on condition that the Earl should give up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>Fescamp, the Earldom of Eu, and Cherbourg,
to William, and withal that the King’s men
should be unmolested in those castles of which
they had possessed themselves in the Earl’s despite.
And the King, on his side, promised to
reduce to their obedience the many castles conquered
by their father, which had since revolted
from the Earl, and also to establish him in the
possession of all their father’s territories abroad,
excepting those places which the Earl had then
given up to the King. Moreover all who had
lost their lands in England on account of the
Earl were to regain them by this treaty, and the
Earl also was to receive certain estates in England
then specified. It was also agreed that if
the Earl died leaving no legitimate son, the King
should be heir of all Normandy, and in like
manner if the King died, that the Earl should be
heir of all England. Twelve of the chief men
on the part of the King and twelve on that of the
Earl guaranteed this treaty by oath; yet it was
observed but a short time. During this peace
Edgar Ætheling was dispossessed of those lands
which the Earl had granted him, and he departed
and went from Normandy into Scotland, to the
King his brother in law, and his sister. Whilst
King William was out of England, Malcolm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>King of Scotland invaded this country, and
ravaged great part of it, till the good men to
whom the keeping of the land was entrusted, sent
their troops against him and drove him back.—When
King William heard this in Normandy,
he hastened to return, and he came to England
and his brother Earl Robert with him. And
they called out a fleet and army, but almost all the
ships were lost, a few days before Michaelmas,
ere they reached Scotland. And the King and
his brother proceeded with the army: and when
King Malcolm heard that they sought to attack
him he marched with his array out of Scotland
into Lothian in England, and remained there. And
when King William approached, Earl Robert
and Edgar Ætheling mediated a peace between
the Kings, on condition that King Malcolm
should repair to our King, and become his vassal,
in all the like subjection as to his father before
him; and this he confirmed by oath. And King
William promised him all the lands and possessions
that he held under his father. By this
peace Edgar Ætheling was reconciled to the
King. And the Kings separated in great friendship,
but this lasted during a short time only.—Earl
Robert abode here with the King till Christmas
drew near, and in this time he found little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>good faith as to the fulfilment of the treaty, and
two days before the feast he took ship from
Wight and sailed to Normandy, and Edgar
Ætheling with him.</p>


<p class="center">1092.</p>

<p>This year King William went northward to
Carlisle with a large army, and he repaired the
city, and built the castle. And he drove out
Dolfin who had before governed that country,
and having placed a garrison in the castle, he
returned into the south, and sent a great number
of Englishmen thither with their wives and
cattle, that they might settle there and cultivate
the land.</p>


<p class="center">1093.</p>

<p>This year, in Lent, King William was very
sick at Gloucester, insomuch that he was universally
reported to be dead: and he made many
good promises in his illness; that his future life
he would lead in righteousness—that the churches
of God he would guard and free—and never
more sell them for money—and that he would
have all just laws in his kingdom. And he gave
the Archbishoprick of Canterbury, which he had
hitherto kept in his own hands, to Anselm who
was before this Abbot of Bec, and the Bishoprick
of Lincoln to his Chancellor Robert; and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>granted lands to many, monasteries, but afterwards,
when recovered, he took them back, and
he neglected all the good laws that he had promised
us. After this the King of Scotland sent
desiring that the stipulated conditions might be
performed; and King William summoned him
to Gloucester, and sent hostages to him in Scotland,
and afterwards Edgar Ætheling and others
met him and brought him with much honour to
the Court. But when he came there he could
neither obtain a conference with our King, nor
the performance of the conditions formerly promised
him, and therefore they departed in great
enmity: and King Malcolm returned home to
Scotland, and as soon as he came thither, he assembled
his troops and invaded England, ravaging
the country with more fury than behoved
him: and Robert Earl of Northumberland with
his men lay in wait for him, and slew him
unawares. He was killed by Moræl of Bamborough,
the Earl’s steward, and King Malcolm’s
own Godfather: his son Edward, who had he
lived would have been King after his father, was
killed with him. When the good Queen Margaret
heard that her most beloved Lord, and her
son were thus cut off, she was grieved in spirit
unto death, and she went with her priest into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>church, and having gone through all befitting
rites, she prayed of God that she might give up
the ghost. And then, the Scots chose Dufenal
the brother of Malcolm for their King, and
drove out all the English who had been with
King Malcolm. When Duncan the son of King
Malcolm heard all this, for he was in King William’s
Court, and had remained here from the
time that his father gave him as an hostage to
our King’s father, he came to the King, and did
such homage as the King required; and thus
with his consent he departed for Scotland, with
the aid that he could muster, both English and
French, and he deprived his kinsman Dufenal
of the throne, and was received as King. But
then some of the Scotch again gathered themselves
together, and slew nearly all his men, and
he himself escaped with few others. They were
afterwards reconciled on this condition, that
Duncan should never more bring English or
Frenchmen into that country.</p>


<p class="center">1094.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King William held
his Court at Gloucester: and there came messengers
to him out of Normandy from his brother
Robert, and they said that his brother renounced
all peace and compact if the King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>would not perform all that they had stipulated in
the treaty; moreover they called him perjured
and faithless unless he would perform the conditions,
or would go to the place where the treaty
had been concluded and sworn to, and there
clear himself. Then at Candlemas the King
went to Hastings, and whilst he waited there for
a fair wind, he caused the monastery on the field
of battle to be consecrated; and he took the staff
from Herbert Losange, Bishop of Thetford.—After
this, in the middle of Lent, he went over
sea to Normandy. When he came thither he and
his brother Earl Robert agreed that they would
meet in peace, and they did so, to the end that
they might be reconciled. But afterwards, when
they met attended by the same men who had
brought about the treaty, and had sworn to see
it executed, these charged all the breach of faith
upon the King; he would not allow this, neither
would he observe the treaty, on which they separated
in great enmity. And the King then seized
the castle of Bures and took the Earl’s men who
were in it, and he sent some of them over to
this country. And on the other hand the Earl
with the assistance of the King of France, took
the castle of Argentses (Argentan) in which he
seized Roger the Poitevin and 700 of the King’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>soldiers; and he afterwards took the castle of
Hulme; and frequently did each burn the towns
and take captive the people of his rival. Then
the King sent hither and ordered out 20,000 Englishmen
to aid him in Normandy, but when
they reached the sea, they were desired to return,
and to give to the King’s Treasury the money
that they had received; this was half a pound
for each man, and they did so. And in Normandy,
after this, the Earl with the King of
France and all the troops that they could collect,
marched towards Eu, where King William then
was, purposing to besiege him therein, and thus
they proceeded until they came to Longueville,
and there the King of France turned off through
treachery, and on this the whole army dispersed.
In the mean time King William sent for his
brother Henry who was in the castle of Domfront,
and because he could not pass through
Normandy in security, he sent ships for him,
with Hugo Earl of Chester. And when they
should have made for Eu, where the king was,
they directed their course instead to England,
and landed at Southampton on the eve of All
Saints’ day; and they then remained in this country,
and were in London at Christmas.
The same year also the Welsh gathered themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>together, and made war upon the French
in Wales, or in the neighbouring parts, where
they had been before deprived of their lands,
and they stormed many fortresses and castles,
and slew the men, and afterwards their numbers
increased so much, that they divided themselves
into many bodies; Hugo, Earl of Shropshire
fought with one division, and put it to flight, but
nevertheless the others abstained not, during the
whole year, from committing every outrage in
their power. This year also the Scots conspired
against their King Duncan and slew him, and
they afterwards took his uncle Dufenal a second
time for their king; through whose instructions
and instigation Duncan had been betrayed to his
death.</p>


<p class="center">1095.</p>

<p>This year King William was at Hwitsand
during the first four days of Christmas, and after
the fourth day he set sail and landed at Dover.
And the King’s brother Henry remained in this
country till Lent, and then he went over sea to
Normandy, with much treasure to be employed
in the King’s service against their brother Earl
Robert: and he gained ground upon the Earl
continually, and did much damage to his lands
and subjects. Then at Easter the King held his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>Court at Winchester, and Robert Earl of Northumberland
would not repair thither; therefore
the King’s anger was greatly stirred up against
him, and he sent to him, and sternly commanded
that if he would remain in peace he should come
to his Court at Pentecost. This year Easter fell
on the 8th of the calends of April, and after
Easter, on the night of the feast of St. Ambrose
the 2d of the nones of April, there was seen all
over the country a great multitude of stars falling
from heaven during nearly the whole of the
night, not one or two at a time, but so thickly
that no man might number them. After this at
Pentecost the King was at Windsor, and all his
Witan with him, excepting the Earl of Northumberland,
for the King would neither give hostages
nor pledge his troth that he should come
and go in security. On this the King called out
an army, and marched against the Earl into
Northumberland, and as soon as he came thither
he seized almost all the chief men of the Earl’s
court in a certain fortress, and he put them in confinement.
And he besieged Tinmouth castle
until he took it, and there he seized the Earl’s
brother, and all who were with him: thence he
proceeded to Bamborough, and there he besieged
the Earl; and when the King found that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>could not reduce him, he caused a castle to be
built over against Bamborough, and called it in
his speech Malveisin, which is in English “the
evil neighbour,” and he garrisoned it strongly,
and afterwards he departed southward. Then
one night soon after the King’s return into the
south, the Earl went out of Bamborough towards
Tinmouth, but those in the new castle being
aware of his design, pursued and attacked him,
and they wounded him, and afterwards took him
prisoner, and some of his followers were slain,
and some taken alive. In the mean time the
King was told, that the Welch had stormed a
certain castle in Wales, called Montgomery, and
had slain Earl Hugo’s men who defended it; on
this he commanded another army to be called
out in haste, and after Michaelmas he proceeded
into Wales. He divided his forces, and his
troops made their way through all parts of the
country, and met at Snowdon, on All Saints’ day.
But the Welch ever fled before him to the mountains
and moors, so that no man could get near
them, and the King at length returned homewards,
because he found that he could do no
more there that winter. When the King came
back, he commanded his people to take Robert.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>Earl of Northumberland and lead him to
Bamborough, and to put out both his eyes, unless
the besieged would surrender the castle,
which was defended by his wife, and his
steward Moreal, who was also his kinsman.
On this, the castle was given up, and Moreal
was received at William’s Court; and through
him many were discovered, both clergy and
laity, who had aided this rebellion with their
counsel. Then the King ordered some of them
to be imprisoned before Christmas, and he
straightly commanded throughout the kingdom,
that all who held lands of him should
be at his Court on that festival, as they would
retain his protection. And the King had Earl
Robert brought to Windsor, and confined
there in the castle. This year also, a little before
Easter, the Pope’s Legate came to England;
this was Walter Bishop of Alba, a man of a very
virtuous life, and at Pentecost he presented
Archbishop Anselm with his pall from Pope
Urban, and he received it at his metropolitan
city of Canterbury. And Bishop Walter remained
here great part of this year, and on his
return the Romescot, which had not been paid
for many years before, was sent with him. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>year also the weather was very unseasonable, so
that the fruits of the earth were much injured
over all the country.</p>


<p class="center">1096.</p>

<p>This year King William held his Christmas
Court at Windsor; and William Bishop of Durham
died there on New Year’s day. And the
King and all his Witan were at Salisbury on the
octaves of Epiphany. There Geoffrey Bainard
accused William of Eu the King’s relation, saying
that he had been concerned in the conspiracy
against the King, and for this cause he fought
with him and overcame him in single combat,
and after he was vanquished the king commanded
that his eyes should be put out; and the king
also caused his steward named William, who was
his aunt’s son, to be hanged on the gallows.—Then
also Eoda Earl of Champaigne the King’s
uncle, and many others, were deprived of their
lands, and some were brought to London, and
there executed. At Easter, this year, there was
a very great stir in this country and in many
others also, through Urban, who was called Pope,
though he was not in possession of the See of
Rome: and an innumerable multitude of men,
with their wives and children, departed to go
and conquer the heathen nations. The King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>and his brother Earl Robert were reconciled in
consequence of this expedition, so that the King
went over sea, and received from the Earl all
Normandy for a sum of money, according to
contract. And thereupon the Earl departed, and
with him went the Earls of Flanders and of
Boulogne, and many other chieftains. And Earl
Robert and those who accompanied him abode
in Apulia that winter. But of those who went
by Hungary, many thousands perished miserably
there, or on the road, and many, rueful and
hunger-bitten, toiled homewards against winter.
These were very hard times to all the English,
as well because of the manifold taxes, as of the
very grievous famine which sorely afflicted the
land. This year also the nobles who had charge
of this country frequently sent forth armies into
Wales, and thus they greatly oppressed many
and for no purpose, but with much loss of men
and of money.</p>


<p class="center">1097.</p>

<p>This year King William was in Normandy
at Christmas, and before Easter he sailed for this
land, intending to hold his Court at Winchester,
but he was kept at sea by bad weather till Easter
eve; and Arundel was the first place to which
he came, therefore he held his Court at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>Windsor. After this, he marched into Wales
with a large army, and his troops penetrated far
into the country by means of some Welchmen
who had come over to him, and were his guides.
And William remained there from Midsummer
till near August, to his great loss of men and
horses and many other things.</p>

<p>When the Welch had revolted from the King
they chose several leaders from among themselves,
one of these was named Cadugan, he was
the more powerful of them all, and was the son
of King Griffin’s brother. The King seeing that
he could not effect his purpose returned into
England, and he forthwith caused castles to be
built on the marches. Then at Michaelmas, on
the 4th of the nones of October, an uncommon
star appeared shining in the evening, and soon
going down: it was seen in the south-west, and
the light which streamed from it seemed very
long, shining towards the south-east; and it appeared
after this manner nearly all the week.—Many
allowed that it was a comet. Soon after
this, Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury obtained
permission from the King, though against his
inclination, to leave this country and go over sea,
because it seemed to him that in this nation little
was done according to right, or after his desires.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>And at Martinmas the King went over sea to
Normandy; but whilst he waited for a fair wind,
his train did as much injury in the county in
which they were detained, as any Prince’s retinue,
or even an army could have committed in
a peaceable land.</p>

<p>This year was in all respects a very heavy
time, and the weather was singularly bad at the
seasons when men should till their lands and
gather in the harvest; and the people had nevertheless
no respite from unjust taxes. Many shires,
moreover, which are bound to duty in works at
London, were greatly oppressed in making the
wall around the tower, in repairing the bridge
which had been almost washed away, and in
building the King’s hall at Westminster; these
hardships fell upon many. This year also, at
Michaelmas, Edgar Ætheling, with the King’s
aid, led an army into Scotland, and won that
country by hard fighting, and drove out the King
Dufenal, and established his kinsman Edgar the
son of King Malcolm and Queen Margaret, as
King holding of William, and then he returned
into England.</p>


<p class="center">1098.</p>

<p>This year King William was in Normandy at
Christmas; and Walcelin Bishop of Winchester,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>and Baldwin Abbot of St. Edmund’s, both
died during this festival. This year also died
Turold Abbot of Peterborough. Moreover in
the summer Of this year a spring of blood burst
out at Finchamsted, in Berkshire, according to
the declaration of many men of credit, who said
that they had seen it. And Earl Hugo was slain
in Anglesey by foreign pirates; his brother Robert
succeeded him, having obtained this of the
King. Before Michaelmas-day the heaven appeared
as it were on fire, almost all the night.—This
was a year of much distress, caused by the
manifold oppressive taxes; nearly all the crops
in the marsh lands failed also from the great
rains, which ceased not the whole year.</p>


<p class="center">1099.</p>

<p>This year King William was in Normandy at
Christmas; and at Easter he came hither; and
at Pentecost he held his Court for the first time
in the new building at Westminster, and there
he gave the Bishoprick of Durham to his chaplain
Rannulf, who had long been the chief
manager and director in all the king’s councils
held in England. And soon afterwards William
went over sea, and drove Earl Elias from Maine,
and brought that province into subjection; and
at Michaelmas he returned to this land. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>year also, on St. Martin’s day, there was so very
high a tide, and the damage was so great in consequence,
that men remembered not the like to
have ever happened before, and the same day
was the first of the new moon. And Osmond
Bishop of Salisbury died during Advent.</p>


<p class="center">1100.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King William held
his Court in Gloucester; and at Easter in Winchester;
and at Pentecost in Westminster. And
at Pentecost blood was observed gushing from
the earth, at a certain town of Berkshire, even
as many asserted who declared that they had
seen it. And after this, on the morning after
Lammas day, King William was shot with an
arrow by his own men, as he was hunting, and
he was carried to Winchester and buried there.
This was in the thirteenth year from his accession.
He was very powerful, and stern over his
lands and subjects, and towards all his neighbours,
and much to be dreaded, and through the
counsels of evil men which were always pleasing
to him, and through his own avarice, he was
ever vexing the people with armies and with
cruel taxes; for in his days all justice sank,
and all unrighteousness arose, in the sight of
God and the world. He trampled on the Church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>of God, and as to the Bishopricks and Abbacies,
the incumbents of which died in his reign,
he either sold them outright, or kept them in
his own hands and set them out to renters;
for he desired to be the heir of every one, churchman
or layman, so that the day on which he
was killed he had in his own hands the Archbishoprick
of Canterbury, the Bishopricks of
Winchester and Salisbury, and eleven Abbacies,
all let out to farm, and in fine, however long I
may delay mention of it, all that was abominable
to God and oppressive to men was common in
this island in William’s time: and therefore he
was hated by almost all his people, and abhorred
by God as his end sheweth, in that he died in
the midst of his unrighteousness, without repentance
or any reparation made for his evil deeds.
He was slain on a Thursday, and buried the next
morning; and after he was buried, the Witan
who were then near at hand, chose his brother
Henry as King, and he forthwith gave the
Bishoprick of Winchester to William Giffard,
and then went to London; and on the Sunday
following he made a promise to God and all the
people, before the altar at Westminster, that he
would abolish the injustice which prevailed in
his brother’s time, and that he would observe the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>most equitable of the laws established in the days
of any of the Kings before him: and after this
Maurice Bishop of London consecrated him as
King, and all the men of this land submitted to
him, and swore oaths and became his liege-men.
And soon afterwards, the King, by the advice of
those about him, caused Rannulf Bishop of Durham
to be taken and brought into the Tower
of London, and confined there. Then before
Michaelmas Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury
came to this land; King Henry having sent for
him by the advice of his Witan, because he had
left the country on account of the injustice done
him by King William. And soon afterwards the
King took for his wife Mahald the daughter of
Malcolm King of Scotland and of the good
Queen Margaret King Edward’s kinswoman, of
the true Royal line of England; and on Martinmas
day she was given to him with great pomp
at Westminster, and Archbishop Anselm wedded
her to Henry, and afterwards consecrated her as
Queen. And soon after this Thomas Archbishop
of York died. This year also, in the autumn,
Earl Robert came home into Normandy, and
Robert Earl of Flanders and Eustace Earl of
Boulogne also returned from Jerusalem, and on
Earl Robert’s arrival in Normandy he was joyfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>received by all the people, excepting those
in the castles which were garrisoned with King
Henry’s men, and these he made many efforts to
win.</p>


<p class="center">1101.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Westminster, and at Easter at Winchester.
And soon afterwards the chief men of this
land entered into a league against the king, both
from their own great treachery, and through
Robert Earl of Normandy who had hostile designs
upon this land. And then the King sent
out ships to annoy and hinder his brother, but
some of them failed at time of need, and deserted
from the King and submitted to Earl Robert.—At
Midsummer the King posted himself with all
his troops at Pevensey to oppose his brother,
and he waited for him there. And in the meantime
Earl Robert landed at Portsmouth twelve
nights before Lammas, and the King marched
against him with all his forces; but the chief
men interfered and made peace between them, on
condition that the King should give up all those
places in Normandy which he then detained
from his brother by force of arms; and that all
who had lost their lands in England on the Earl’s
account should have them again, and that Earl
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>Eustace should also have his father’s estates in
this country, and that Earl Robert should receive
yearly 3000 marks of silver from England;
and it was stipulated by this treaty that whichever
of the brothers outlived the other, he should
inherit all England together with Normandy,
unless the deceased left legitimate issue. And
twelve men of the highest rank on either side
confirmed this treaty by oath: and the Earl
afterwards remained here till after Michaelmas;
and his men did much harm wherever they went,
whilst the Earl staid in this land. This year
also, at Candlemas, Bishop Rannulf escaped by
night from the Tower of London, in which he
was confined, and went to Normandy. It was
at his incitement chiefly, that Earl Robert was
spirited up to invade this land.</p>


<p class="center">1102.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was at Westminster
during the feast of the Nativity, and at Easter
he was at Winchester. And soon afterwards a
difference arose between the King and Robert
of Belesme, who held the Earldom of Shrewsbury
in this country, which his father Earl
Roger had enjoyed before him, and who had
other great possessions both here and abroad;
and the King went and besieged Arundel castle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>and when he found that he should not be able
to take it speedily, he caused castles to be built
before it, and garrisoned with his men; and then
he led all his troops to Bridgenorth, and remained
there till he had reduced the castle, and
deprived Earl Robert of his lands, and he took
from him all that he possessed in England, so the
Earl departed over sea, and the King’s soldiers
were disbanded and returned home. On the
Michaelmas following the King was at Westminster,
with all the head men of this land, both
clergy and laity; and Archbishop Anselm held
a synod, at which many decrees were made
touching the Christian religion; and many Abbots,
both French and English, lost their staffs
and their abbacies, because they had obtained
them unlawfully, or had lived unrighteously
therein. And the same year, in Pentecost week,
there came robbers, some from Auvergne, some
from France, and some from Flanders, and they
brake into the monastery of Peterborough, and
carried off much treasure of gold and silver;
crosses, chalices, and candlesticks.</p>


<p class="center">1103.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was at Westminster at
Christmas. And soon afterwards the Bishop
William Giffard departed from this land, because
he would not against right, receive consecration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>from Gerard Archbishop of York. And at
Easter the King held his Court at Winchester;
and afterwards, Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury
journeyed to Rome, as he and the King had
agreed. This year also Earl Robert of Normandy
came to this land, to speak with the King,
and before he departed hence he gave up the
3000 marks which King Henry should have paid
him yearly according to the treaty. This year
blood was seen gushing out of the earth at
Hampstead, in Berkshire. This was a year of
much distress from the manifold taxes, and also
from a mortality among the cattle, and from the
failure of the crops, both of the corn and all
fruits of trees. In the morning also of St. Lawrence’s
day, the wind did so much damage to all
the fruit of this land, that no man remembered
the like to have ever happened before. The
same year died Mathias Abbot of Peterborough,
who had not lived more than one year after he
was made Abbot. After Michaelmas, on the 12th
of the calends of November, he was received in
procession as Abbot, and the same day the year
following he died at Gloucester, and there he
was buried.</p>


<p class="center">1104.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Westminster, at Easter at Winchester,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>and at Pentecost again at Westminster. This
year the first day of Pentecost was on the nones
of June, and on the Tuesday after, at mid-day,
there appeared four circles of a white colour
round the sun, one under the other as if they
had been painted. All who saw it wondered,
because they never remembered such before.—An
alliance was afterwards formed between Robert
Earl of Normandy and Robert of Belesme,
whom King Henry had deprived of his estates,
and driven out of England, and from this, the
King of England and the Earl of Normandy
became at variance. And the King sent his
people over sea into Normandy, and the head
men of that country received them, and admitted
them into their castles in treachery to their Lord
the Earl, and they greatly annoyed the Earl by
plundering and burning his territories. This
year also, William Earl of Moreton (Mortaigne)
departed to Normandy, and being there,
he took arms against the King, on which the
King confiscated all his possessions and estates
in this country. It is not easy to describe the
misery of this land, which it suffered at this
time through the various and manifold oppressions
and taxes that never ceased or slackened:
moreover wherever the King went his train fell to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>plundering his wretched people, and withal there
was much burning and manslaughter. By all
this was the anger of God provoked, and this
unhappy nation harrassed.</p>


<p class="center">1105.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Windsor, and the following Lent he
went over sea to Normandy against his brother
Earl Robert. And whilst he remained there he
won Caen and Baieux from his brother, and
almost all the castles and chief men of that land
became subject to him; and in the autumn he
came again to this country. And all that he had
conquered in Normandy remained to him afterwards
in peace and subjection, excepting those
places which lay in the neighbourhood of William
Earl of Mortaigne, and which he harrassed
continually as much as harrass he might, in revenge
for the loss of his estates in England. Then
before Christmas Robert de Belesme came hither
to the King. This was a year of great distress
from the failure of the fruits, and from the manifold
taxes which never ceased, either before the
King went abroad, while he was there, or again
after his return.</p>


<p class="center">1106.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry was at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>Westminster, and there he held his court, and
during this festival Robert de Belesme departed
from the King in enmity, and left this country
for Normandy. After this, and before Lent,
the King was at Northampton, and his brother
Earl Robert of Normandy came to him there;
and because the King would not give up that
which he had won from the Earl in Normandy,
they separated in enmity, and the Earl soon went
again over sea. In the first week of Lent, on
the evening of Friday, the 14th of the calends
of March, a strange star appeared, and it was
seen a while every evening for a long time afterwards.
This star appeared in the south-west,
it seemed small and dim, but the light that stood
from it was very bright and like an exceedingly
long beam shining to the north-east; and one
evening it seemed as if a beam from over against
the star darted directly into it. Some persons
said that they observed more unknown stars at
this time, but we do not write this as a certainty
because we saw them not ourselves. One night,
the morrow being the day of our Lord’s Supper,
that is, the Thursday before Easter, two moons
appeared before day in the heavens, the one in
the east and the other in the west, both full;
and the same day was the 14th of the moon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>At Easter the King was at Bath, and at Pentecost
at Salisbury, because he would not hold his
Court over sea during his absence from this
country. After this, before August, the King
went into Normandy, and almost all the inhabitants
bowed to his will, excepting Robert de Belesme,
and the Earl of Mortaigne, and a few
other chiefs who yet held with the Earl of Normandy:
the King therefore came with an army,
and besieged a castle of the Earl of Mortaigne
called Tinchebray. Whilst the King was besieging
this castle, Robert Earl of Normandy
and his army came upon him on Michaelmas eve,
and with him were Robert de Belesme and William
Earl of Mortaigne, and all who wished well
to their cause, but strength and victory were with
the King. The Earl of Normandy was taken,
together with the Earl of Mortaigne and Robert
de Stutteville; and they were afterwards sent to
England, and kept in confinement; Robert de
Belesme was put to flight, and William Crispin
was taken, with many others; Edgar Ætheling
who had gone over from the King to the Earl a
short time before, was also taken; but the King
afterwards let him depart unhurt. After this, the
King subdued the whole of Normandy, and
brought it under his own will and power. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>year, also there was a very terrible and sinful
war between the Emperor of Saxony and his son,
during which the father died, and the son succeeded
to the Empire.</p>


<p class="center">1107.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was in Normandy at
Christmas and reduced that land, and having
settled the government, he came to England the
following Lent; and he held his Court at Windsor
at Easter, and at Pentecost he held it at
Westminster. And in the beginning of August
he was again at Westminster, and there he gave
away Bishopricks and Abbacies, disposing of
such as were without elders and pastors, both in
England and Normandy; the number of these
was so great that no man remembered that so
many were ever before given away at one time.
And amongst others who then received Abbacies,
Ernulf Prior of Canterbury obtained that Of
Peterborough. This was about the seventh year
of King Henry’s reign, and the one and fortieth
year that the French ruled in this land. Many
said that they saw various tokens in the moon
this year, and its light waxing and waning contrary
to nature. This year died Maurice Bishop
of London, and Robert Abbot of St. Edmund’s
Bury, and Richard Abbot of Ely. This year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>also Edgar King of Scotland died on the ides of
January, and his brother Alexander succeeded to
the kingdom with King Henry’s consent.</p>


<p class="center">1108.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry was at
Westminster; and at Easter at Winchester; and
at Pentecost again at Westminster. After this,
before August, he went into Normandy. And
Philip King of France dying on the nones of
August, his son Louis succeeded him, and there
were afterwards many battles between the Kings
of France and of England, whilst Henry remained
in Normandy. This year also Gerard
Archbishop of York died before Pentecost, and
Thomas was afterwards appointed as his successor.</p>


<p class="center">1109.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was in Normandy both
at Christmas and at Easter; and before Pentecost
he came hither and held his Court at Westminster,
at which place the stipulations were ratified, and
the oaths sworn, relative to the marriage of his
daughter with the Emperor. There was much
thunder this year and that very terrible. And
Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury died on the
11th of the calends of April, and the first day of
Easter was on the greater Litany.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p class="center">1110.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Westminster; and at Easter he was at
Marlborough; and at Pentecost he held his
Court for the first time in the New Windsor.
This year, before Lent, the King sent his
daughter with manifold treasures over sea, and
gave her to the Emperor. On the fifth night
of the month of May the moon appeared shining
brightly in the evening, and afterwards its light
waned by little and little, and early in the night
it was so wholly gone that neither light, nor
circle, nor any thing at all of it was to be seen,
and thus it continued till near day, and then it
appeared shining full and bright; it was a fortnight
old the same day: the sky was very clear
all the night, and the stars shone very brightly
all over the heavens, and the fruit trees were
greatly injured by that night’s frost. After this,
in the month of June, there appeared a star in
the north-east, and its light stood before it to the
south-west, and it was seen thus for many nights,
and ever as the night advanced it mounted upwards
and was seen going off to the north-west.
This year Philip de Brause, and William Mallet,
and William Baynard were deprived of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>lands. This year also died Earl Elias, who whilst
living held Maine of King Henry, but on his death
the Earl of Anjou took possession of that province,
and kept it against the King’s will. This
was a year of much distress from the taxes
which the King raised for his daughter’s dowry,
and from the bad weather by which the crops
were greatly injured, and nearly all the fruit on
the trees destroyed throughout the country.—This
year men first began to work at the new
monastery of Chertsey.</p>


<p class="center">1111.</p>

<p>This year King Henry wore not his crown at
Christmas, nor at Easter, nor at Pentecost.—And
in August he was called over sea to Normandy,
by the hostility of certain of his enemies
on the marches of France, and principally by
that of the Earl of Anjou who held Maine against
him: and after his arrival many were the intrigues
and great the burning and plundering
carried on by either party against the other.—This
year Robert Earl of Flanders died and his
son Baldwin succeeded him. The winter was
very long this year, a heavy and a severe time,
by which the fruits of the earth were much injured;
and there was the greatest pestilence
among the cattle ever remembered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p class="center">1112.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry remained in Normandy,
on account of the war in which he was
engaged with France, and with the Earl of
Anjou, who held Maine against him. And whilst
he was there he deprived the Earl of Evreux
and William Crispin of their lands, and drove
them out of Normandy: and he restored to Philip
de Brause the estates which had been taken from
him, and he caused Robert de Belesme to be
seized and put into prison. This was a very
good year as to the crops, the trees and fields
being very fruitful; but it was a very heavy and
a sorrowful time, by reason of a dreadful pestilence
among men.</p>


<p class="center">1113.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was in Normandy at
Christmas, at Easter, and at Pentecost. And in
the summer he sent hither Robert de Belesme, to
be confined in Wareham castle, and he himself
came to this land soon afterwards.</p>


<p class="center">1114.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Windsor, and he held no Court again
this year. And at Midsummer he entered Wales
with an army, and the Welch came and treated
with the King, and he caused castles to be built
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>in that country. And in September he went over
sea to Normandy. In the end of May, this year,
a strange star with a long light was seen shining
for many nights. This year also there was so
great an ebb of the tide every where in one day,
as no man remembered before, so that men went
through the Thames both riding and walking,
east of London bridge. This year there were
very high winds in the month of October, and
more especially on the night of the octaves of
St. Martin, as was apparent in all woods and
towns. This year also the King gave the Archbishoprick
of Canterbury to Ralph Bishop of
Rochester; and Thomas Archbishop of York
died, and the King’s Chaplain Turstein succeeded
him. At this time the King went towards the
sea, and he would have gone over but he was
detained by the weather. In the mean while he
sent his writ to Ernulf Abbot of Peterborough,
desiring him to come to him with speed, for that
he would speak with him on something of importance.
On Ernulf’s arrival, the King and the
Archbishops and Bishops, and the English Nobility
who attended the King, forced him to
accept the Bishoprick of Rochester; he withstood
them long, but his resistance availed nothing.
And the King commanded the Archbishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>to take him to Canterbury, and to consecrate
him as Bishop whether he would or not.—This
was done in the town called Burne (Sittingburn?)
on the 17th of the calends of October.
When the monks of Peterborough heard this,
they were so sorry as never before, because
Ernulf was a very good and a mild man, and did
much good within the monastery and out of it
whilst he remained there. May Almighty God
be ever with him. Soon afterwards, at the request
of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the King
gave that Abbacy to a monk of Sees named John.
And soon after this the King and the Archbishop
sent him to Rome for the Archbishop’s pall, and
with him a monk named Warner, and the Archdeacon
John the Archbishop’s nephew, and they
sped well on their journey. This was done on
the 11th of the calends of October, at the town
called Rugenor (Rowner, near Gosport), and the
same day the King took ship at Portsmouth.</p>


<p class="center">1115.</p>

<p>This year, during Christmas, King Henry was
in Normandy, and whilst he was there he caused
all the chief men of Normandy to do homage and
swear oaths of allegiance to his son William,
whom he had by his Queen; and afterwards in
the month of July he returned hither. This year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>the winter was so severe with snow and with frost,
that no man then living remembered a harder:
and it occasioned much disease among the cattle.
This year Pope Paschal sent hither a pall to
Archbishop Ralph, and he received it with much
pomp at his see of Canterbury. Anselm an Abbot
of Rome, the nephew of Archbishop Anselm, and
John Abbot of Peterborough, brought the pall
from Rome.</p>


<p class="center">1116.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry was at
St. Alban’s, and there he caused the monastery to
be consecrated; and at Easter he was at Wudiham
(Odiham). And this year also, the winter
being severe and long, it was a very heavy time
for the cattle and all things. And soon after
Easter the King went over sea, and much treachery
was practised, and there was plundering
and taking of castles between France and Normandy.
The chief cause of enmity was that
King Henry aided his nephew Earl Theobald de
Blois, who was then at war with his Lord Louis
King of France. This was a very calamitous
year, the crops being spoiled by the heavy rains,
which came on just before August and lasted till
Candlemas. Mast also was so scarce this year
that none was to be heard of in all this land, or in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>Wales: moreover this land and nation were
many times sorely oppressed by the taxes which
the King raised both within the towns and out of
them. This year also the whole of the monastery
of Peterborough was burnt, with all the
houses, excepting the chapter-house and the
dormitory: and the greater part of the town was
burnt also. All this happened on a Friday, being
the 2d of the nones of August.</p>


<p class="center">1117.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry abode in Normandy,
because of the war with the King of France and
his other neighbours: then in the summer the
King of France, and the Earl of Flanders with
him, entered Normandy with an army, and remained
in the country one night, and went away
again in the morning without fighting. And
Normandy was greatly oppressed by taxes and by
the levies of troops that King Henry raised to oppose
them. This nation also was sorely aggrieved
in like manner, to wit, by the manifold
taxes. This year also there was a violent storm
of thunder and lightning, rain and hail, on the
night of the calends of December; and on the 3d
night of the ides of December the moon appeared
for a long time as it were bloody, and then it was
darkened. Also, on the night of the 17th of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>calends of January the heaven appeared very
red, as if it were burning. And on the octave of
St. John the Evangelist’s day there was a great
earthquake in Lombardy, by which many monasteries,
towers, and houses were thrown down, and
the inhabitants suffered greatly. This was a very
bad year for the corn, through the rains which
ceased scarcely at all. And Gilebert Abbot of
Westminster died on the 8th of the ides of December,
and Farits Abbot of Abingdon died on
the 7th of the calends of March. And the same
year ——</p>


<p class="center">1118.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry was in Normandy,
being at war with the King of France, and with
the Earl of Anjou, and with the Earl of Flanders.
And the Earl of Flanders was wounded in Normandy,
on which he returned to Flanders. The
King was greatly impoverished by this war, and
lost much money and land, and he was most
harrassed by his own men, who continually revolted
and betrayed him, and went over to his
enemies, and treacherously gave up their castles
in the King’s despite. England paid dearly for
all this by the manifold taxes which ceased not all
this year. This year, one evening in Epiphany
week, there was dreadful lightning which caused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>many deaths. And Queen Mahald (Matilda)
died at Westminster on the calends of May, and
was buried there. And Robert Earl of Mellent
also died this year. This year also, on St. Thomas’
day, there was so exceedingly high a wind
that none who then lived remembered a greater,
and this might be seen every where from the state
of the houses and of the trees. Pope Paschal also
died this year, and John of Gaieta, whose other
name was Gelasius, succeeded to the Popedom.</p>


<p class="center">1119.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry remained in Normandy,
and was greatly harrassed by the war with the
King of France, and by the treachery of his own
men, who were continually revolting from him,
till at length the two Kings with their forces met
in Normandy. The King of France was there
put to flight and all his best men taken, and
many of King Henry’s vassals who had kept their
castles against him, now submitted, and were
reconciled to him, and some of the castles he took
by force. This year, William the son of King
Henry and of Queen Mahald went to Normandy
to his father, and the daughter of the Earl of
Anjou was there given and wedded to him. On
Michaelmas eve there was a great earthquake in
some parts of this land; and it was felt most in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>Gloucestershire and Worcestershire. The same
year Pope Gelasius died on this side of the mountains,
and he was buried at Cluny; and the
Archbishop of Vienne was chosen Pope, his
name was Calixtus. He afterwards came to
Rheims, in France, on the feast of St. Luke the
Evangelist, and held a council there. And Turstein
Archbishop of York journeyed thither, and
because he received consecration from the Pope,
against right, and to the prejudice of the see of
Canterbury, and against the King’s will, Henry
wholly forbade his return to England; and being
thus deprived of his Archbishoprick, he proceeded
with the Pope towards Rome. This year also
Baldwin Earl of Flanders died of the wound
which he had received in Normandy, and was
succeeded by Charles the son of his aunt and of
St. Cnut, King of Denmark.</p>


<p class="center">1120.</p>

<p>This year peace was made between the Kings
of England and of France, and after this all King
Henry’s own men in Normandy made their peace
with him; also the Earls of Flanders and of Ponthieu.
Then the King ordered and disposed of
his castles and land in Normandy after his own
will; and so, before Advent, he returned to England.
And the King’s two sons William and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>Richard were drowned in the passage, together
with Richard Earl of Chester, and Ottuel his
brother; and very many of the King’s Court;
stewards, and chamberlains, and butlers, and
other men in office, and an innumerable multitude
of all ranks, were also lost. The manner of
their death was a twofold grief to their friends,
first because they lost their lives so suddenly,
and next that few of their bodies were ever found.
And this year that remarkable light twice came
upon our Lord’s sepulchre at Jerusalem, once at
Easter, and again on the Assumption of St. Mary,
according to the report of men of credit, who
came from thence. And Turstein Archbishop of
York was reconciled to the King through the
Pope, and he came to this land, and was put in
possession of his Archbishoprick, though much
against the will of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>


<p class="center">1121.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry was at
Bramtun (Brampton ?), and before Candlemas
Athelis was given him to wife at Windsor, and
afterwards consecrated Queen; she was the
daughter of the Duke of Louvain. And the
moon was eclipsed on the night of the nones of
April, being the 14th day of the moon. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>the King was at Berkeley at Easter, and the
Pentecost following he held a great Court at
Westminster, and in the summer he entered
Wales with an army, and the Welch came to
meet him, and made a treaty with him on his
own terms. This year the Earl of Anjou returned
from Jerusalem to his own land, and after
this he sent hither to fetch away his daughter
who had been married to the King’s son William.
And on the night of Christmas eve there
was a very high wind throughout this land, as
might be seen plainly in its effects.</p>


<p class="center">1122.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was at Norwich at
Christmas, and at Easter he was at Northampton.
And the town of Gloucester was burned the
Lent before, for while the monks were singing
mass, the deacon having begun the gospel “<i>Præteriens
Jesus</i>,” the fire fell on the top of the
steeple, and it burned the whole monastery, and
all the treasures in it, excepting a few books and
three vestments: this happened on the 8th of
the ides of March. And there was a very high
wind on the Tuesday after Palm Sunday, the
11th of the Calends of April: and after this many
strange tokens were noticed throughout England,
and many ghosts were seen and heard. And on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>the night of the 8th of the calends of August,
there was a great earthquake throughout Somersetshire
and Gloucestershire. Again on the 6th
of the ides of September, St. Mary’s day, there
was a very high wind, which continued from
nine in the morning till dark night. The same
year Ralph Archbishop of Canterbury died on
the 13th of the calends of November. After this
many shipmen were at sea, and on the water, and
said that they saw a fire in the north-east, large
and broad, near the earth, and that it grew in
height unto the welkin, and the welkin divided
into four parts and fought against it, as it would
have quenched it; nevertheless the fire flamed
up to heaven. They observed this fire at day-break,
and it lasted until it was light every
where: this was on the 7th of the ides of December.</p>


<p class="center">1123.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was at Dunstaple at
Christmas, and the messengers from the Earl of
Anjou came to him there, and he proceeded thence
to Woodstock, and his Bishops and all his Court
with him. Now it fell out on a Wednesday,
being the 4th of the ides of January, that the
King rode in his deer-park, and Roger Bishop
of Salisbury was on one side of him, and Robert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>Bloet Bishop of Lincoln on the other; and they
rode there talking. Then the Bishop of Lincoln
sank down, and said to the King, “Lord King!
I am dying,”—and the King alighted from his
horse, and took him between his arms, and bade
them bear him to his inn, and he soon lay there
dead; and they took his body with much pomp
to Lincoln, and Robert Bishop of Chester, who
was called Pecceth, buried him before St. Mary’s
altar. Soon after this the King sent his writs
over all England, and desired his Bishops, his
Abbots, and his Thanes, that they should all
come to the meeting of his Witan at Gloucester,
on Candlemas day, and they obeyed; and when
they were there assembled the King bade them
choose to themselves whomsoever they would as
Archbishop of Canterbury, and that he would
confirm their choice. Then the Bishops spake
among themselves, and said that they would
never more have a man of any monastic order
as Archbishop over them. And they all with
one accord went to the King, and entreated that
they might choose one of the clergy for their
Archbishop, and to this the King consented.—All
this had been set on foot by the Bishop of
Salisbury, and by the Bishop of Lincoln before
he died, for they never loved the monks’ rules,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>but were ever against the monks and their rules
also. And the Prior and monks of Canterbury
and all others of the monastic order who were
there, resisted this proceeding two full days, but
in vain, for the Bishop of Salisbury was very
powerful, and swayed all England, and he was
against them with all his might. Then they
chose a clerk named William of Corboyl, he was
a canon of a monastery called Cice (St. Osith);
and they brought him before the King, who gave
him the Archbishoprick, and he was received by
all the Bishops; but the Monks and Earls, and
almost all the Thanes who were there, would not
acknowledge him. At this same time the messengers
of the Earl departed from the King dissatisfied,
nothing regarding his gifts. At this time also a
Legate arrived from Rome; his name was Henry,
and he was Abbot of the monastery of St. Jean
d’Angely. He came for the Romescot; and he told
the King that a clerk had no right to be set over
monks, and that therefore they had formerly
chosen the Archbishop in the chapter, as was
befitting; but, for love of the Bishop of Salisbury,
the King would not undo his act. Soon
afterwards, the Archbishop went to Canterbury,
and was received, though unwillingly, and he
was forthwith consecrated there by the Bishop
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>of London, and Ernulf Bishop of Rochester, and
William Giffard Bishop of Winchester, and
Bernard Bishop of Wales (St. David’s), and
Roger Bishop of Salisbury. Then early in
Lent the Archbishop journeyed to Rome for his
pall, and Bernard Bishop of Wales, and Sefred
Abbot of Glastonbury, and Anselm Abbot of St.
Edmund’s, and John Archdeacon of Canterbury,
and Gifard who was the King’s chaplain, went
with him. Thurstan Archbishop of York went
to Rome at the same time by order of the Pope,
and he arrived three days before the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and was received with much
honour. Then came the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and it was a full week before he could
obtain an audience of the Pope, because the
Pope had been given to understand that he had
received the Archbishoprick in opposition to the
monks of the monastery, and against right; but
that which overcometh all the world, namely
gold and silver, overcame Rome also, and the
Pope relented and gave him his pall, and the
Archbishop swore obedience in all things that he
should impose, on the heads of St. Peter and
St. Paul, and the Pope then sent him home with
his blessing. Whilst the Archbishop was abroad,
the King gave the Bishoprick of Bath to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>Queen’s Chancellor, named Godfrey; he was of
Louvain: this was done at Woodstock on the
day of St. Mary’s Annunciation. Soon afterwards
the King went to Winchester, where he
remained during the festival of Easter; and
while there he gave the Bishoprick of Lincoln
to a clerk named Alexander, who was a nephew
of the Bishop of Salisbury, and he did this all
for love of that Bishop. Then the King proceeded
to Portsmouth, and staid there over Pentecost
week; and as soon as he had a fair wind
he sailed for Normandy, having committed all
England to the care and administration of Roger
Bishop of Salisbury. The King was in Normandy
all this year, and a great war broke out
between him and his Thanes, for Earl Waleram
of Mellent, and Hamalri, and Hugh of Montfort,
and William of Roumare, and many others
revolted from him and held their castles against
him; and the King on his part opposed them
with vigour, and the same year he won from
Waleram his castle of Pont-au-de-mer, and from
Hugh that of Montfort, and after this his affairs
continued to prosper more and more. The same
year, before the Bishop of Lincoln came to his
see, nearly the whole town of Lincoln was burnt,
with a great number of persons, both men and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>women, and so much harm was done that no
man could tell another how great the damage
was. This happened on the 14th of the calends
of June.</p>


<p class="center">1124.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry was in Normandy,
being detained there by his great wars with
Louis King of France, and the Earl of Anjou,
and with his own subjects most of all. Then it
befel on the day of St. Mary’s Annunciation that
Waleram Earl of Mellent was going from one
of his castles called Beaumont, to another, Watteville,
and Amalri the steward of the King of
France, and Hugh the son of Gervais, and Hugh
of Montfort, and many other good Knights went
with him. Then the King’s Knights from all
the neighbouring castles came against them, and
fought with them, and put them to flight, and
they took the Earl Waleram, and Hugh the son
of Gervais, and Hugh of Montfort, and five and
twenty other Knights, and brought them to the
King; and the King caused Earl Waleram and
Hugh the son of Gervais to be confined in the
castle of Rouen, and he sent Hugh of Montfort
to England, and caused him to be put in evil
bonds in that of Gloucester, and as many of the
others as he thought fit he sent north and south
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>to his castles for confinement. Then the King
went on, and won all Earl Waleram’s castles in
Normandy, and all the others which his enemies
held against him. All this was on account of
the son of Robert Earl of Normandy named
William. The same William had married the
younger daughter of Fulk Earl of Anjou, and
for this cause the King of France, and all the
Earls and great men held with him, and said that
the King did wrongfully keep his brother Robert
in confinement, and that he had unjustly driven
his son William out of Normandy. This year there
was much unseasonable weather which injured the
corn and all fruits in England, so that, between
Christmas and Candlemas, one acre’s seed of
wheat, that is two seedlips, sold for six shillings,
and one of barley, that is three seedlips, for six
shillings, and one acre’s seed of oats, being four
seedlips, for four shillings. It was thus, because
corn was scarce, and the penny was so bad, that
the man who had a pound at the market, could
hardly, for any thing, pass twelve of these pennies.
The same year, the holy Bishop of Rochester
Ernulf, who had been Abbot of Peterborough,
died on the ides of March. Thereafter
died Alexander King of Scotland, on the 9th of
the calends of May, and his brother David, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>Earl of Northamptonshire, succeeded him, and
held at the same time both the kingdom of Scotland
and the English earldom. And the Pope
of Rome called Calixtus died on the 19th of the
calends of January, and Honorius succeeded
to the Popedom. The same year, after St. Andrew’s
day, and before Christmas, Ralph Basset,
and the King’s Thanes held a Witenagemot at
Hundhoge (Huncot), in Leicestershire, and there
they hanged more thieves than had ever before
been executed within so short a time, being in all
four and forty men: and they put out the eyes of
six.—Many men of truth said that several there
suffered with great injustice, but our Lord God
Almighty who seeth and knoweth all hidden
things, seeth that the miserable people is oppressed
with all unrighteousness; first men are
bereaved of their own, and then they are slain.
Full heavy a year was this; he who had any
property was bereaved of it by heavy taxes and
assessments, and he who had none, starved with
hunger.</p>


<p class="center">1125.</p>

<p>Before Christmas, this year, King Henry sent
from Normandy to England, and commanded that
all the moneyers of England should be deprived of
their limbs, namely of their right hands.—And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>this, because a man might have a pound, and yet
not be able to spend one penny at a market. And
Roger Bishop of Salisbury sent over all England,
and desired all of them to come to Winchester at
Christmas; and when they came thither his men
took them one by one, and cut off their right hands.
All this was done within the twelve days, and with
much justice, because they had ruined this land
with the great quantity of bad metal which they all
bought. This year the Pope of Rome sent John
of Crema, a Cardinal, to this land. He first
came to the King in Normandy, and the King
received him with much honour, and commended
him to William Archbishop of Canterbury, who
conducted him to Canterbury; and he was there
received with much pomp, and a great procession,
and he sang the high mass at Christ’s
altar on Easter day; and then he journeyed over
all England, to all the Bishopricks and Abbacies,
and he was honourably received every
where, and all gave him great and handsome
gifts; and in September he held his council in
London full three days (beginning) on the Nativity
of St. Mary, with the Archbishops, Bishops,
and Abbots, and the clergy and laity, and he
sanctioned the laws which Archbishop Anselm
had made, and he enacted many others, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>they remained in force but a little while.—Thence
he went over sea soon after Michaelmas,
and so to Rome. William Archbishop of Canterbury,
and Thurstan Archbishop of York, and
Alexander Bishop of Lincoln, and John Bishop
of Lothene (Glasgow), and Geoffrey Abbot of
St. Alban’s, accompanied him, and were received
with great honour by the Pope Honorius, and
they remained there the whole winter. The
same year there was so great a flood on St. Lawrence’s
day, that many towns were deluged, and
men drowned, the bridges were broken up, and,
the corn fields and meadows spoiled; and there
was famine and disease upon men and cattle; and
it was so bad a season for all fruits as had not
been for many years before. The same year
John Abbot of Peterborough died on the 2d of
the ides of October.</p>


<p class="center">1126.</p>

<p>This year King Henry was in Normandy till
after harvest; and he came to this land between
the Nativity of St. Mary, and Michaelmas, accompanied
by the Queen, and by his daughter
whom he had before given in marriage to the
Emperor Henry of Lorrain. He brought with
him the Earl Waleram, and Hugh the son of
Gervais, and he imprisoned the Earl at Bridgenorth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>and he afterwards sent him to Wallingford,
and he sent Hugh to Windsor, and caused
him to be put into hard bonds. And after
Michaelmas David King of Scotland came hither,
and King Henry received him with much honour,
and he abode through the year in this land.—The
same year the King caused his brother Robert
to be taken from Roger Bishop of Salisbury,
and delivered to his son Robert Earl of Gloucester,
and he caused him to be removed to
Bristol, and put into the castle. All this was
done through the advice of his daughter, and of
her uncle David King of Scotland.</p>


<p class="center">1127.</p>

<p>This year, at Christmas, King Henry held his
Court at Windsor, and David King of Scotland
was there, and all the head men of England,
both clergy and laity. And the King caused the
Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Earls, and all the
Thanes who were present, to swear to place England
and Normandy after his death in the hands
of his daughter the Princess, who had been the
wife of the Emperor of Saxony. And then he
sent her to Normandy, accompanied by her brother
Robert Earl of Gloucester, and by Brian
the son of the Earl Alein Fergan; and he caused
her to be wedded to the son of the Earl of Anjou,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>named Geoffrey Martel. Howbeit this displeased
all the French and the English, but the King
did it to obtain peace from the Earl of Anjou
and aid against his nephew William. The same
year Charles Earl of Flanders was slain in Lent,
by his own men, as he lay before the altar in a
church, and prayed to God during mass. And
the King of France brought William the son of
the Earl of Normandy, and gave him the earldom,
and the men of Flanders received him.—The
same William had before taken to wife the
daughter of the Earl of Anjou, but they were
afterwards divorced because of their nearness of
kin, and this through the interference of Henry
King of England; he afterwards married the
sister of the King of France, and on this account
the King gave him the earldom of Flanders.—The
same year Henry gave the Abbacy of Peterborough
to an Abbot named Henry of Poitou,
who was in possession of the Abbacy of St. Jean
d’Angely; and all the Archbishops and Bishops
said that this grant was against right, and that
he could not have in hand two Abbacies. But
the same Henry made the King believe that
he had given up his Abbey on account of the
great disquietude of the land, and that he had
done so by the order and with the leave of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>Pope of Rome, and of the Abbot of Cluny, and
because he was Legate for collecting the Romescot.
Nevertheless it was not so, but he wished
to keep both Abbeys in his own hands, and he
did hold them as long as it was the will of God.
In his clerkship he was Bishop of Scesscuns
(Soissons), afterwards he was a monk at Cluny,
then Prior of the same monastery, and next he
was Prior of Savenay; after this, being related
to the King of England and to the Earl of Poitou,
the Earl gave him the Abbey of St Jean
d’Angely. Afterwards by his great craft he
obtained the Archbisboprick of Besançon, and
kept possession of it three days; and then lost
he it right worthily, in that he had gotten it with
all injustice. He then obtained the Bishoprick
of Saintes, which was five miles from his own
Abbey, and he kept this for nearly a week, but
here again the Abbot of Cluny displaced him,
as he had before removed him from Besançon.
Now he bethought himself that if he could be
sheltered in England, he might have all his will,
on which he besought the King, and said to him
that he was an old man, and a broken-down, and
that he could not endure the wrongs and oppressions
of that land, and he asked the King, himself,
and through all his friends, by name for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>Abbacy of Peterborough. And the King granted
it to him, forasmuch as he was his kinsman, and
in that he had been one of the first to swear
oaths, and to bear witness, when the son of the
Earl of Normandy and the daughter of the Earl
of Anjou were divorced on the plea of kindred.—Thus
vexatiously was the Abbacy of Peterborough
given away at London, between Christmas
and Candlemas; and so Henry went with
the King to Winchester, and thence he came to
Peterborough, and there he lived even as a drone
in a hive; as the drone eateth and draggeth forward
to himself all that is brought near, even so
did he; and thus he sent over sea all that he
could take from religious or from secular, both
within and without; no good there he did, nor
any did he leave there. Let no man think
lightly of the marvel that we are about to relate
as a truth, for it was full well known over all the
country. It is this; that as soon as he came to
Peterborough; it was on the Sunday when men
sing “<i>Exsurge quare O Domine</i>;” several persons
saw and heard many hunters hunting.—These
hunters were black and large and loathly,
and their hounds were all black, with wide eyes
and loathly, and they rode on black horses and
on black bucks. This was seen in the very deer-park
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>of the town of Peterborough, and in all the
woods from the same town to Stamford; and the
monks heard the blasts of the horns which they
blew in the night. Men of truth kept in the
night their watch on them, and said that there
might well be about 20 or 30 horn-blowers.—This
was seen and heard from the time that the
Abbot came thither, all that Lent, until Easter.
Such was his entrance, of his exit we can say
nothing yet: God knoweth it.</p>


<p class="center">1128.</p>

<p>All this year King Henry was in Normandy,
on account of the war between him and his
nephew the Earl of Flanders; but the Earl was
wounded in battle by a servant, and being so
wounded he went to the monastery of St. Bertin,
and forthwith he was made a monk, and lived
five days after, and then died, and was buried
there: God rest his soul! He was buried on the
6th of the calends of August. The same year
died Randulf Passeflambard Bishop of Durham,
and he was buried there on the nones of September.
And this year the aforesaid Abbot Henry
went home to his own monastery in Poitou, with
the King’s leave. He had given the King to
understand that he would wholly quit that monastery,
and that country, and abide with him in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>England, and at his monastery of Peterborough.
But so it was not, for he spake thus guilefully,
wishing to remain there a twelvemonth or more,
and then to return again. May Almighty God
have mercy upon this wretched place. The same
year Hugh of the Temple came from Jerusalem
to the King in Normandy, and the King received
him with much honour, and gave him much
treasure in gold and silver, and afterwards he
sent him to England, and there he was well received
by all good men, and all gave him treasures;
and in Scotland also: and they sent in all
a great sum of gold and silver by him to Jerusalem.
And he invited the people out to Jerusalem,
and there went with him and after him
so great a number, as never before since the first
expedition in the days of Pope Urban. Yet this
availed little: he said that there was a furious
war between the christians and the heathens, and
when they came there it was nothing but leasing.—Thus
were all these people miserably betrayed.</p>


<p class="center">1129.</p>

<p>This year the King sent to England after Earl
Waleram, and after Hugh the son of Gervais;
and there they gave him hostages, and Hugh
went home to France his own country, and
Waleram remained with the King, and the King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>gave him all his lands, excepting his castle alone.
Then the King came to England in harvest, and
the Earl came with him, and they were as great
friends as they had been enemies before. Then
soon, by the King’s counsel and consent, William
Archbishop of Canterbury sent over all
England, and commanded the Bishops, and Abbots,
and Archdeacons, and all the Priors, Monks,
and Canons of all the cells of England, and all
who had the charge and oversight of the Christian
religion, that they should come to London
at Michaelmas, to hold conference upon all God’s
rights. When they came thither, the meeting
began on the Monday and lasted till the Friday,
and it came out that it was all concerning the
wives of Archdeacons and Priests, that they
should part with them by St. Andrew’s day; and
that he who would not do this, should forego his
church, his house, and his home, and never be
permitted again to claim them. This was ordered
by William Archbishop of Canterbury,
and all the Bishops of England; and the King
gave them leave to depart, and so they went
home, and these decrees were in no respect observed,
for all kept their wives, by the King’s
permission, even as before. The same year William
Giffard Bishop of Winchester died, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>was buried there on the 8th of the calends of
February; and after Michaelmas the King gave
the Bishoprick to his Nephew Henry Abbot of
Glastonbury, and he was consecrated by William
Archbishop of Canterbury on the 15th of the
calends of December. The same year died
Pope Honorius, and before he was well dead,
two Popes were chosen. The one was named
Peter, he was a monk of Cluny, and descended
from the greatest men of Rome, and the Romans
and the Duke of Sicily held with him; the other
was named Gregory, he was a clerk, and he was
driven from Rome by the other Pope and his
kinsmen, and he was acknowledged by the Emperor
of Saxony, by the King of France, by
Henry King of England, and by all on this side
the mountains. There was now so great a
division in Christendom, that the like had never
been before: May Christ appoint good counsel
for his miserable people! The same year there
was a great earthquake on St. Nicholas’ night, a
little before day.</p>


<p class="center">1130.</p>

<p>This year the monastery of Canterbury was
consecrated by Archbishop William, on the
4th of the nones of May. The following Bishops
were there: John of Rochester, Gilbert Universalis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>of London, Henry of Winchester, Alexander
of Lincoln, Roger of Salisbury, Simon
of Worcester, Roger of Coventry, Godfrey
of Bath, Everard of Norwich, Sigefrid of Chichester,
Bernard of St. David’s, Audoenus of
Evreux, in Normandy, and John of Seez.
On the 4th day after this, King Henry was at
Rochester, and nearly the whole town was burnt
down; and Archbishop William and the aforesaid
Bishops consecrated St. Andrew’s monastery.
And King Henry went over sea to Normandy
during harvest. The same year Henry Abbot of
Angely came to Peterborough after Easter, and
said that he had wholly given up that monastery.
After him, the Abbot of Cluny named Peter
came to England with the King’s leave, and he
was received with much honour wherever he
went; he came to Peterborough, and there the
Abbot Henry promised that he would obtain for
him the monastery of Peterborough, and that it
should be annexed to Cluny; but as it is said in
the proverb, “The Hedge still stands—That
parts the Lands.” May Almighty God frustrate
evil counsels! And soon afterwards the Abbot of
Cluny went home to his own country.</p>


<p class="center">1131.</p>

<p>This year, on a moonlight night after Christmas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>during the first sleep, the northern half of
the heaven was, as it were, a burning fire; so
that all who saw it were more affrighted than
ever they were before; this happened on the 3d
of the ides of January. The same year there
was so great a pestilence amongst animals over
all England, as had not been in the memory of
man; it chiefly fell on cattle and on swine, so
that in the town where ten or twelve ploughs had
been going, not one remained, and the man, who
had possessed two or three hundred swine, had
not one left him. After this the hens died; and
flesh-meat became scarce, and cheese, and butter.
God mend the state of things when such is his
will! And King Henry came home to England
before harvest, after the latter feast of St. Peter.
The same year before Easter the Abbot Henry went
from Peterborough over sea to Normandy, and
there he spoke with the King, and told him that
the Abbot of Cluny had commanded him to come
over, and resign to him the Abbey of Angely;
and that then, with his leave, he would return
home: and so he went to his own monastery and
abode there till Midsummer day. And, on the
day after the feast of St. John, the monks chose
an Abbot from among themselves, and brought
him into the church in procession; they sang
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span><i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, they rang the bells, and they set
him on the Abbot’s seat, and they did all obedience
to him, even as they would to their Abbot; and
the Earl and all the chief men and the monks
drove the other Abbot Henry out of the monastery,
and well they might, for in five and twenty
years they had never known a good day. All
his great craftiness failed him here, and now it
behoved him to creep into any corner, and to
consider if perchance there yet remained some
slippery device, by which he might once more
betray Christ and all christian people. Then
went he to Cluny, and there they kept him, so
that he could go neither east nor west; the
Abbot of Cluny saying that they had lost St.
Jean through him, and his great sottishness;
wherefore seeing he could give no better compensation,
he promised and swore on the holy relics,
that if he might proceed to England he would
obtain for them the monastery of Peterborough,
and would establish there a Prior of Cluny, a
church-warden, a treasurer, and a keeper of the
robes, and that he would make over to them all
things both within and without the monastery.
Thus he went into France and abode there all
the year. May Christ provide for the wretched
monks of Peterborough, and for that miserable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>place, for now do they stand in need of the help
of Christ and of all christian people.</p>


<p class="center">1132.</p>

<p>This year King Henry returned to this land:
then the Abbot Henry came, and accused the
monks of Peterborough to the King, because he
desired to subject that monastery to Cluny; so
that the King was well nigh beguiled, and sent
for the monks; but by God’s mercy, and through
the Bishops of Salisbury and Lincoln, and the
other great men who were there, he found out
that the Abbot dealt treacherously. When he
could do no more, he wished that his nephew
might be Abbot of Peterborough, but this was
not the will of Christ. It was not very long after
this that the King sent for him, and made him
give up the Abbey of Peterborough, and depart
out of the country, and the King granted the
Abbacy to a Prior of St. Neot’s named Martin,
and he came to the monastery, right worshipfully
attended, on St. Peter’s day.</p>


<p class="center">1135.</p>

<p>This year, at Lammas, King Henry went over
sea: and on the second day, as he lay asleep in
the ship, the day was darkened universally, and
the sun became as if it were a moon three nights
old, with the stars shining round it at mid-day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>Men greatly marvelled, and great fear fell on
them, and they said that some great event should
follow thereafter—and so it was, for the same
year the King died in Normandy, on the day
after the feast of St. Andrew. Soon did this land
fall into trouble, for every man quickly began to
rob his neighbour as he might. Then King
Henry’s sons and his friends took his body, and
brought it to England, and buried it at Reading.
He was a good man, and great was the awe of
him; no man durst ill treat another in his time:
he made peace for men and deer. Whoso bare
his burden of gold and silver, no man durst say
to him aught but good. In the mean time his
nephew Stephen de Blois had arrived in England,
and he came to London, and the inhabitants
received him, and sent for the Archbishop
William Corboyl, who consecrated him King on
midwinter-day. In this King’s time was all discord,
and evil-doing, and robbery; for the
powerful men who had kept aloof, soon rose
up against him; the first was Baldwin de Redvers,
and he held Exeter against the King, and
Stephen besieged him, and afterwards Baldwin
made terms with him. Then the others took
their castles, and held them against the King,
and David King of Scotland betook him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>Wessien,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[BJ]</a> but, notwithstanding his array, messengers
passed between them, and they came
together, and made an agreement, though it
availed little.</p>


<p class="center">1137.</p>

<p>This year King Stephen went over sea to Normandy,
and he was received there because it was
expected that he would be altogether like his
uncle, and because he had gotten possession of
his treasure, but this he distributed and scattered
foolishly. King Henry had gathered together
much gold and silver, yet did he no good for
his soul’s sake with the same. When King
Stephen came to England he held an assembly
at Oxford; and there he seized Roger Bishop of
Salisbury, and Alexander Bishop of Lincoln,
and Roger the Chancellor, his nephew, and he
kept them all in prison till they gave up their
castles. When the traitors perceived that he
was a mild man, and a soft, and a good, and that
he did not enforce justice, they did all wonder.
They had done homage to him, and sworn oaths,
but no faith kept they; all became forsworn, and
broke their allegiance, for every rich man built
his castles, and defended them against him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>and they filled the land full of castles. They
greatly oppressed the wretched people by making
them work at these castles, and when the castles
were finished they filled them with devils and
evil men. Then they took those whom they
suspected to have any goods, by night and by
day, seizing both men and women, and they put
them in prison for their gold and silver, and tortured
them with pains unspeakable, for never
were any martyrs tormented as these were. They
hung some up by their feet, and smoked them
with foul smoke; some by their thumbs, or by
the head, and they hung burning things on their
feet. They put a knotted string about their heads,
and writhed it till it went into the brain. They
put them into dungeons wherein were adders and
snakes and toads, and thus wore them out. Some
they put into a crucet-house, that is, into a
chest that was short and narrow, and not deep, and
they put sharp stones in it, and crushed the man
therein so that they broke all his limbs. There
were hateful and grim things called Sachenteges
in many of the castles, and which two or three
men had enough to do to carry. The Sachentege
was made thus: it was fastened to a beam,
having a sharp iron to go round a man’s throat and
neck, so that he might no ways sit, nor lie, nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>sleep, but that he must bear all the iron. Many
thousands they exhausted with hunger. I cannot
and I may not tell of all the wounds, and all the
tortures that they inflicted upon the wretched men
of this land; and this state of things lasted the 19
years that Stephen was King, and ever grew worse
and worse. They were continually levying an
exaction from the towns, which they called Tensery,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[BK]</a>
and when the miserable inhabitants had no
more to give, then plundered they, and burnt all
the towns, so that well mightest thou walk a
whole day’s journey nor ever shouldest thou find
a man seated in a town, or its lands tilled.</p>

<p>Then was corn dear, and flesh, and cheese,
and butter, for there was none in the land—wretched
men starved with hunger—some lived
on alms who had been erewhile rich: some fled
the country—never was there more misery, and
never acted heathens worse than these. At
length they spared neither church nor churchyard,
but they took all that was valuable therein,
and then burned the church and all together.
Neither did they spare the lands of Bishops,
nor of Abbots, nor of Priests; but they robbed
the monks and the clergy, and every man plundered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>his neighbour inasmuch as he might. If
two or three men came riding to a town, all the
township fled before them, and thought that they
were robbers. The Bishops and clergy were
ever cursing them, but this to them was nothing,
for they were all accursed, and forsworn, and
reprobate. The earth bare no corn, you might
as well have tilled the sea, for the land was all
ruined by such deeds, and it was said openly
that Christ and his Saints slept. These things,
and more than we can say, did we suffer during
19 years because of our sins. Through all this
evil time the Abbot Martin held his Abbacy for
20 years, and a half, and eight days, with many
difficulties: and he provided the monks and
guests with all necessaries, and kept up much
alms in the house; and withal he wrought upon
the church, and annexed thereto lands and rents,
and enriched it greatly, and furnished it with
robes: and he brought the monks into the new
monastery on St. Peter’s day with much pomp.
This was in the year 1140 of our Lord’s incarnation,
the 23d year after the fire. And he went
to Rome and was well received there by Pope
Eugenius, and he obtained sundry privileges,
to wit, one for all the abbey lands, and another
for the lands that adjoin the monastery, and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>he lived longer he meant to have done as much
for the treasurer’s house. And he regained certain
lands that powerful men possessed by force;
he won Cottingham and Easton from William
Malduit, who held Rockingham castle, and from
Hugh of Waltville he won Hyrtlingberi (Artleborough),
and Stanwick, and sixty shillings
yearly out of Aldewingle (Oldwincle). And he
increased the number of monks, and planted a
vineyard, and made many works, and improved
the town; and he was a good monk and a good
man, and therefore God and good men loved
him.—Now will we relate some part of what
befel in King Stephen’s time. In his reign the
Jews of Norwich bought a Christian child before
Easter, and tortured him with all the torments
wherewith our Lord was tortured, and they crucified
him on Good Friday for the love of our Lord,
and afterwards buried him. They believed
that this would be kept secret, but our Lord
made manifest that he was a holy martyr, and
the monks took him and buried him honourably
in the monastery, and he performed manifold
and wonderful miracles through the power of
our Lord, and is called St. William.</p>


<p class="center">1138.</p>

<p>This year David King of Scotland entered this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>land with an immense army resolving to conquer
it, and William Earl of Albemarle, to whose
charge the King had committed York, and other
trusty men, came against him with few troops,
and fought with him, and they put the King to
flight at the Standard, and slew a great part of
his followers.</p>


<p class="center">1140.</p>

<p>This year Stephen attempted to take Robert
Earl of Gloucester the son of King Henry, but
failed, for Robert was aware of his purpose.—After
this, in Lent, the sun and the day were
darkened about noon, when men eat, so that they
lighted candles to eat by. This was on the 13th
of the calends of April, and the people were
greatly astonished. After this William Archbishop
of Canterbury died, and the King made
Theobald Abbot of Bec Archbishop. Then
there arose a very great war between the King
and Randolf Earl of Chester, not because the
King did not give him all that he could ask,
even as he did to all others, but that the more he
gave them, the worse they always carried themselves to
him. The Earl held Lincoln against
the King, and seized all that belonged to the
King there, and the King went thither, and besieged
him and his brother William de Romare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>in the castle: and the Earl stole out and went
for Robert Earl of Gloucester, and brought him
thither with a large army; and they fought
furiously against their Lord on Candlemas day,
and they took him captive, for his men betrayed
him and fled, and they led him to Bristol, and
there they put him into prison and close confinement.
Now was all England more disturbed
than before, and all evil was in the land. After
this, King Henry’s daughter, who had been Empress
of Germany, and was now Countess of
of Anjou, arrived, and she came to London, and
the citizens would have seized her, but she fled
with much loss. Then Henry Bishop of Winchester,
King Stephen’s brother, spake with
Earl Robert and with the Empress, and swore
them oaths that he never more would hold with
the King his brother, and he cursed all those
that did hold with him, and he said that he would
give up Winchester to them, and he made them
come thither. But when they were in that place
Stephen’s Queen brought up her strength and
besieged them, till there was so great a famine in
the town, they could endure it no longer. Then
stole they out and fled, and the besiegers were
aware of them, and followed them, and they
took Robert Earl of Gloucester and led him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>Rochester, and imprisoned him there: and the
Empress fled into a monastery. Then wise men,
friends of the King and of the Earl, interfered
between them, and they settled that the King
should be let out of prison for the Earl, and the
Earl for the King; and this was done. After
this the King and Earl Randolf were reconciled
at Stamford, and they took oaths and pledged
their troth, that neither would betray the other:
but this promise was set at nought, for the
King afterwards seized the Earl in Northampton
through wicked counsel, and put him in prison,
but he set him free soon after, through worse, on
condition that he should swear on the cross and
find hostages that he would give up all his
castles. Some he did deliver up, and others
not; and he did worse than he should have done
in this country. Now was England much
divided, some held with the King and some with
the Empress, for when the King was in prison
the Earls and the great men thought that he
would never more come out, and they treated
with the Empress, and brought her to Oxford,
and gave her the town. When the King was
out of prison he heard this, and he took his army
and besieged her in the tower, and they let her
down from the tower by night with ropes, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>she stole away, and she fled: and she went on
foot to Wallingford. After this she went over
sea, and all the Normans turned from the King
to the Earl of Anjou, some willingly, and some
against their will; for he besieged them till they
gave up their castles, and they had no help from
the King. Then the King’s son Eustace went to
France, and took to wife the sister of the King
of France: he thought to obtain Normandy
through this marriage, but little he sped, and
that of right, for he was an evil man, and did
more harm than good wherever he went: he
spoiled the lands, and laid thereon heavy taxes:
he brought his wife to England, and put her into
the castle of ——; she was a good woman but
she had little bliss with him, and it was not the
will of Christ that he should bear rule long, and
he died, and his mother also. And the Earl of
Anjou died, and his son Henry succeeded him;
and the Queen of France was divorced from the
the King, and she went to the young Earl Henry
and he took her to wife, and received all Poitou
with her. Then he came into England with
a great army and won castles; and the King
marched against him with a much larger army,
howbeit they did not fight, but the Archbishop
and wise men went between them and made a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>treaty on these terms; that the King should be
Lord and King while he lived, and that Henry
should be King after his death, and that he
should consider him as his father, and the King
him as his son, and that peace and concord
should be between them, and in all England.
The King, and the Earl, and the Bishop, and
the Earls, and all the great men swore to observe
these and the other conditions that were then
made. The Earl was received with much honour
at Winchester and at London, and all did homage
to him, and swore to keep the peace, and it
soon became a very good peace, such as never
was in this land. Then the King was more
powerful here than ever he was; and the Earl
went over sea, and all the people loved him, because
he did good justice, and made peace.</p>


<p class="center">1154.</p>

<p>This year King Stephen died, and he was
buried with his wife and his son at Favres-field
(Feversham); they had built that monastery.—When
the King died the Earl was beyond sea,
and no man durst do other than good for very
dread of him. When he came to England he was
received with much honour, and was consecrated
King at London on the Sunday before Christmas,
and he held a great Court there: and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>same day that Martin Abbot of Peterborough
should have gone thither he sickened, and he
died on the 4th of the nones of January. And
that day the monks chose another Abbot from
among themselves. He is named William de
Waltville, a good clerk, and a good man, and
well beloved of the King and of all good people:
and they buried the Abbot honourably in the
Church, and soon afterwards the Abbot Elect
and the monks went to the King at Oxford, and
the King gave him the Abbacy, and thus he departed,
having received * * * * * * *</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">[Q]</a> This place uncertain—the final ee marks a Bishop’s residence,

other (or 2d) son succeeded to the kingdom of Kent, to Surrey,
and to Sussex.” Henry of Huntingdon and Roger de
Hoveden also make Æthelstan the son of Egbert, but Ethelwerd,
William of Malmesbury, and Asser, speak of him as
the son of Æthelwulf.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[Y]</a> Turner supposes this to be Morton, Berkshire, “because
the Chronicle of Mailros, p. 144, places the battle at Reading,

contains both North Morton and South Morton.”—Hist. Anglo
Saxons, vol. i. p. 240.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[Z]</a> So Lye explains sumor-lida, and with most probability;

For the same purpose it was worn on the Judge’s arm during
trials. See the Chrymogæa of Arngrim Jonas, p. 62 and 76.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[AL]</a> In this part of the Chronicle the Saxon word Burh, which
I have translated town, recurs perpetually; it would appear
that the predatory warfare, existing every where, had compelled
the inhabitants of the country to gather themselves
into townships, for the sake of mutual protection; these were
probably surrounded by some species of inclosure as a defence
against sudden attacks. The erection of a stone wall seems to be
considered worthy of mention, as a work but rarely undertaken.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been changed without notice. Inconsistencies 
in hyphenation have been standardized. 
Other spelling has also been retained as originally published except
for the changes below.</p>

<p>Text has been corrected to match the <a href="#ERRATA">Errata</a> page.
Since the footnotes begin right after the Errata, the note, 
"for Ashdon, &amp;c. read Assington, near Rochford" which points to page 180 actually is
footnote <a href="#Page_420">AV</a>.
